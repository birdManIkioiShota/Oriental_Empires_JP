{UI Influence Culture}
{UI Authority Description,"Authority represents the respect that local leaders have for the central state. It encompases both the fear of retribution for disobedience, and the belief that a central state is necessary and desirable. Your authority determines the number of settlements you can directly control. If you have more settlements than your authority rating then all your settlements will suffer increased noble unrest. Authority will be temporarily reduced when a new faction leader takes over}
{UI Culture Description,"Culture represents that state of advance of your state, and the degree to which your people voluntarily associate with it. Culture reduces unrest among both peasants and nobles, but affects the nobles more. Culture comes from advances in the Technology and Culture tree}
{UI Culture Trade Benefit,"Culture also affects trade. The value of silk, ceramics and local specialties is increased by {0}% if exporting to another power with lower culture}

{UI Conquest Victory Text,"Raw military might is an argument that can only be answered in kind. When none remain who can oppose your argument}
{UI Culture Victory Text,"While conquerors can shape the world for a time, ideas and culture have a more lasting influence. If you can establish your faction as the cultural driving force of the area, then history will consider it the most important of its time. To win a Cultural Victory, you must amass {0:d0} culture victory points and have {1:d}% more points than the second highest player. Your culture victory points are the sum of your culture rating, and all culture victory points from buildings that you have constructed or captured. Palaces, temples}
{UI Glory Victory Text,"Sometimes many factions can co-exist without any one clearly dominating. Deciding which was most important or successful means weighing their size, influence, and cultural achievements. If the game ends without any player winning by another victory condition, then the victor is the player with the highest victory score. This is calculated based on both the cultural victory points, the amount of population controlled directly, or by vassals}
{UI SOH Victory Text,"When you are widely recognized as the Son of Heaven and rightful Emperor, then none can doubt your legitimacy of your rule. You win a Son of Heaven Victory when {0:d0}% of the game's population recognize you as Emperor. Your own population, that of your vassals}

{There is some room to expand to the North}
{WS Advice Zhao}
{As Zhao}
{WS Advice Wei,"Your state has emerged from the break up of the ancient state of Jin}
{Wars are inevitable}
{While your central position is challenging, with skillful diplomacy}
{WS Advice Yue,"Your state was originally founded south of  the Yangtze river}
{Your lands are quite extensive, but they are sparsely populated, and your settlements scattered}
{You have some of room to expand within your own territories, and plenty of potential to expand to the South}
{WS Advice Han}
{There is some room for expansion both north and south of the river, with the south perhaps being a little better. There are also the small states of Zhou and Zheng that you could conquer. However}
{WS Advice Chu,"You start in control of a large swathe of territory on the north bank of the Yangtze River. On paper you are wealthy and powerful, but your cities are far apart. Individually, none of your neighbors is a match for you, but given the distances involved}

{If you can survive, there is space to expand into to the East around the mouth of the Yellow river, and to the North. Expanding east is easier, but is a high risk strategy, and will expose you to both hostile attacks and frequent flooding. Moving north will expose you to the Xiongnu and Dong Hu}

{All in all}
{WS Advice Zheng,"You begin as a single city state to the south of the Yellow River. Although many of the surrounding states are more powerful}

{The nearby powers of Han and Wei will see you as a tempting target, so your priority should be to secure good relations with them.
