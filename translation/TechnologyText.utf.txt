If a note is double the frequencey of another, they are separated by one octave. Practical music requires the octave to be divided into a number of semitones, twelve being the most common, with the frequency of each note being a fixed ratio to the one below.

The development of the stern rudder allows larger vessels to be constructed. It consists of a large central paddle mounted on a post at the rear of the ships. It is moved by handle at the top of the post, which may require several men on larger ships. The rudder post is the strongest part of a ship}
{Tech Paddle Wheel}
{Tech Paddle Wheel Desc,"River ships are traditionally rowed, but the rowing action is not particularly efficient for large ships where the rower sits high above the water line. Paddle wheels driven by men on treadle paddles are more efficient, and can propel river ships to greater speeds}
