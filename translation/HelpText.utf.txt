{HPTitle Unrest}
{HPHeading Unrest Basics}
{HPText Unrest 1,"Unrest occurs when your people are unhappy. Different things make different people unhappy, so there are two types of unrest, ""peasant unrest"" and ""noble unrest"". As a ruler}
{HPText Unrest 2,"The final unrest for each group is composed of three elements, happiness, dissatisfaction, and suppression. The first two are opposed and can cancel each other out. Suppression is a measure of your ability to suppress dissent by use of force or intimidation}
{HPHeading Unrest Effects}
{HPText Unrest Effects 1,"Unrest below 60% has no effect, but remember that random events or fluctuations in local factors can cause it to increase unexpectedly. If unrest goes above this then several bad effects may occur. The income you can collect from the settlement may be reduced, you may not be able to recruit units from some recruitment pools}
{HPText Unrest Effects 2}
{HPHeading Unrest Causes}
{HPText Unrest Causes 1,"Both noble and peasant unrest can be caused by unpopular edicts, military service}
{HPText Unrest Causes 2,"Local factors can be a major cause of dissatisfaction. They represent factors such as ancient grudges, particularly outspoken individuals or local traditions of independence, as well as minor local events such as fights, insults etc. There is nothing you can do about local factors, except to create happiness or suppression to counter them. They vary randomly over time}
{HPText Unrest Causes 3,"Peasant unrest will also increase if there is a shortage of food, overcrowding or they are continually asked to perform labor service constructing buildings or land improvements.  Dissatisfaction due to overcrowding can be reduced by expanding the settlement to a city or large city}
{HPText Unrest Causes 4,"Nobles are inherently independent, and dislike having anyone over them. They will try to assert their independence (which increases their unrest value) when they sense your realm is too large for you to control}
{HPHeader Dealing With Unrest}
{HPText Dealing With Unrest 1,"The best way to do deal with unrest, is either to address the root causes of dissatisfaction}
{HPText Dealing With Unrest 2,"In the short term though, a character with a high Ren(virtue) rating can be sent to the settlement, or military forces placed in the garrison or nearby. Note though, that noble units will not suppress noble unrest}

{HPHeading Army Defections}
{HPText Army Defections 1,"Rebellions are particularly dangerous, because an army close to a rebel stack may defect to the rebels. An army consisting of mainly nobles may defect to a noble rebellion, and an army of mainly militia or tribesmen may defect to a peasant rebellion. The chances of defection depend on the composition of the stack}
{HPText Army Defections 2,"If a garrison stack defects}
{HPLink Rebellions}
{HPTitle Trade}
{HPHeading Trade Basics}
{HPText Trade Basics 1,"Certain buildings and resources on the map provide abstract trade items that can be traded to other settlements generating income. There are a number of different types, including copper, ceramics, silk and jade. They are not directly represented in the game, although sometimes there are benefits to having certain items available at a settlement. To begin trading with nearby settlements, construct a ""bazaar"" building. Upgrading this building will increase the value of trade generated}
{HPText Trade Basics 2,"The revenue generated trading with a particular settlement depends on the goods traded, and the population of the partner settlement. Since you cannot trade an item to a place that already produces it, try to establish production centers for each item}
{HPHeading Trade Routes}
{HPText Trade Routes 1}
{HPText Trade Routes 2,"Trade routes can't run through forests}
{HPHeading Water Trade}
{HPText Water Trade,"Trade may also be conducted along navigable rivers, and across the sea, however it is only possible if both settlements have a ""Quay"" building. Moving goods by water is more efficient, so water borne trade is more valuable}
{HPHeading Internal Trade}
{HPText Internal Trade,"Some buildings that generate tradable items (e.g. ceramics or silk) also generate income from internal trade. Within a settlement. It's not necessary to establish a bazaar to receive this}
{HPHeading Foreign Trade}
{HPText Foreign Trade,"So long as you are not at war, your settlements may also establish trade routes to settlements owned by other players. The value of some trade items is increased if you have a higher culture rating}
{HPHeading Caravansaries}

{HPHead Technology Progress}
{HPText Technology Progress,"In general the rate of development is the same for all players, so small nations develop at the same rate as large ones. However, the rate of progress in certain areas or for specific types of development can be affected by the faction you control, edicts you issue, or buildings you construct. If there is modification to the progress rate of an entire area, it is shown at the top in the tab for that area. If there is modification to a specific item, it is indicated by a colored tab on the tile. Green indicates faster than usual progress, red slower. However}

{HPText Edicts 1,"Each Edict has its own pros and cons. Some have long term benefits, while causing short term unrest, as changing laws always upsets someone. Others may have a cost per turn, or offer a short term gain in return for long term disadvantages. The panel on the left side shows the edicts that you can issue. Click on one to see details}
{HPText Edicts 2,"The panel on the right shows edicts that have already been issued. Selecting one shows details, and may give an option to cancel it. Cancelling an edict too soon after issuing it will make you look weak and indecisive}

{HPText Culture and Authority,"These are two important values that reflect the development of your civilization, and how large it can grow. They are shown in the display in the bottom left of the map screen. They mainly increase from developments in Technology and Culture, as your people develop a shared culture}
{HPHead Authority}
{HPText Authority 1,"Authority is the quantity that governs the relations between you and the nobles of your realm. These have a natural desire to rebel and govern independently, which your authority discourages. In practical terms your Authority rating is the number of settlements you can keep under control. If you have more settlements than your Authority rating, the noble unrest in each one will be greatly increased}
{HPText Authority 2,"Authority comes from developments in Technology and Culture, from Edicts and from military success. It can be lost by cancelling Edicts, military defeats}
{HPHead Culture}
{HPText Culture 1,"Your Culture rating represents your soft power}

The Qi rating of a stack's general also boosts the attack of his men, and many technology advancements will improve effectiveness in combat. In melee}
{HPText Battle Resolution 2,"As units fight and take casualties, their morale will gradually reduce, and if it falls low enough, they will break and run away.

{HPTitle Battle Unit Types}
{HPHeading Battle Unit Infantry}
{HPText Battle Unit Infantry,"Your foot soldiers are the mainstay of most armies. They are particularly useful for siege battles, and suffer little or no penalty for operating in difficult terrain, unless they are armed with long weapons. Infantry can be vulnerable to cavalry or chariots, unless armed with halberds or long spears}
{HPHeading Battle Unit Chariots}
{HPText Battle Unit Chariots 1,"The chariot was a significant advance in military technology. Chariot mounted warriors can move faster, wear heavier armor and carry more ammunition than soldiers on foot. The height of their fighting platform gives them another edge over infantry}
{HPText Battle Unit Chariots 2,"Chariots move faster than infantry in open terrain, but slower in difficult terrain and cannot enter forests. If forced to fight in forests, marshes or on steep slopes}
{HPHeading Battle Unit Cavalry}
{HPText Battle Unit Cavalry,"Cavalry are a cheaper and more efficient way of using horses in battle than chariots. They move faster, suffer lower terrain penalties}
{HPHeading Battle Unit Artillery}
{HPText Battle Unit Artillery 1,"The main use for artillery is to knock down walls and destroy towers in siege battles. Smaller types of engine may not be able to damage the largest walls}
{HPText Battle Unit Artillery 2,"Artillery can also be useful in field battles. However, since they cannot move, they will need to be positioned carefully to be useful. Stone throwers can do a lot of damage, but are inaccurate and can sometimes hit your own troops. Bolt shooters are useful for long range sniping at enemy engines}
{HPText Battle Unit Artillery 3,"When an artillery unit is ordered to move, it is packed up onto carts, and cannot fight in battle. Artillery is thus much easier to use when not moving. If you want to move and fight}

{HPTitle Siege Assaults}
{HPHeading Siege Assault Intro}
{HPText Siege Assault Intro 1,"If you attack a settlement, then a siege assault battle will occur. The attacker's siege engines and archers will attack the settlement walls and towers, trying to create a breach in the wall}
{HPText Siege Assault Intro 2,"The settlement surrenders, and the battle ends when an attacking unit reaches a breach or open gate, and their is no defending unit available to defend it. When the city surrenders}
{HPHeading Settlement Defenses}
{HPText Settlement Defenses,"If a settlement has a wall, it will also have some towers that can fire on the attackers. If missile units are garrisoned in the settlement, they are assumed to be garrisoning the towers, boosting their attack rate, and changing the projectiles used from simple arrows, to whatever they are armed with. A strong garrison will combine some missile units to fire on attackers}
{HPHeading Prolonged Sieges}
{HPText Prolonged Sieges 1,"The attacker must capture the settlement within the time limit allowed for battles, which is usually not possible if the settlement is well defended. If the settlement is not captured, the siege continues}
{HPText Prolonged Sieges 2,"Any damage caused to the defenses is remembered from turn to turn. Two damaged pieces (wall, gate or tower) are automatically repaired each turn}
{HPHeading Unwalled Settlements}
{HPText Unwalled Settlements,"If a settlement has no walls, then the attackers must force their way in along one of the four entry roads. Defending units will defend these as if defending a wall breach, but without protective walls}
