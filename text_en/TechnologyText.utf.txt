{Pastoralists rely on their large flocks of animals to provide them with food. The number of flocks that can be kept is mainly limited by the quantity and quality of land available. A pastoral lifestyle requires far more land to sustain a given population than an agricultural one, and cannot sustain large settlements. It does however allow survival in areas unsuited to agriculture.}
{Tech Nomadism}
{Nomadism}
{Tech Nomadism Desc}
{Flocks need to spread out to find grazing, but the need to keep track of them limits the area that any settlement can make use of. Using horses enables flocks to be controlled over a much wider area, and increasing the amount of land a settlement may use. It also makes it easy for groups to split off to new locations, so this development allows settler units to be recruited at zero cost.}
{Tech Flood Control}
{Flood Control}
{Tech Flood Control Desc}
{Left to their own devices, rivers are capricious, often flooding and changing course suddenly causing massive disruption to agriculture. Dredging their channels and building levees to control their flow makes them a little more predictable, and allows agriculture to be more permanently established.}
{Tech Irrigation}
{Irrigation}
{Tech Irrigation Desc}
{Crops need water to grow, and the supply from rainwater can be unpredictable. Creating a system of channels to distribute water from rivers or bore holes ensures that crops are well watered all year round, whatever the whims of the rain gods.}
{Tech Terracing}
{Terracing}
{Tech Terracing Desc}
{It's difficult to farm hillsides with cereal crops, as water runs off. Converting the slope to a series of stepped terraces provides flat land for cultivation, and allows water to be retained. Generally some method of pumping water up the hillside to the terraces will also be required. }
{Tech Marsh Drainage}
{Marsh Drainage}
{Tech Marsh Drainage Desc}
{Much otherwise useful flat land is too water logged to allow farming or grazing. Although it is very labor intensive, it is possible to construct drainage works to control water flow into and out of a marsh, and thus convert it into a fertile plain that can be farmed or used for grazing flocks.}
{Tech Seedling Transplantation}
{Seedling Transplantation}
{Tech Seedling Transplantation Desc}
{Crop yields for rice can be improved significantly if rice plants are grown from seeds in a nursery area for two to three weeks, before being transplanted to the main field. The small plants in the nursery are easy to care for, and when transplanted, they have a head start over any weeds that would compete with them. Transplanting also allows the part grown plants to be evenly spaced, further increasing yield.}
{Tech Brick Faced Wells}
{Brick Faced Wells}
{Tech Brick Faced Wells Desc}
{The climate is often dry, and it is necessary to draw up water from wells to water the crops, and provide for people and animals. While wells can be dug easily, they collapse quickly if not well lined. A lining of trapezoidal shaped bricks (smaller on the inside than the outside) is easy to lay, and will keep the well open permanently.}
{Tech Crop Rotation}
{Crop Rotation}
{Tech Crop Rotation Desc}
{The five sacred grains that have been grown from ancient times are millet, wheat, rice, soya beans, and sesame. They may be grown at different times of the year, or in different climates. It is better if they are not grown in the same spot each year, as this leads to depletion of the soil, and a build up of weeds and pests. Rotating the different crops between different fields significantly increases the yield.}
{Tech Composite Bow}
{Composite Bow}
{Tech Composite Bow Desc}
{Unlike a simple bow, a composite bow is made of multiple materials, wood, sinew or horn, glued together. Using different materials on inner and outer edges allows it to bend further, allowing construction of bows that are powerful without being unduly large.}
{Tech Crossbow}
{Crossbow}
{Tech Crossbow Desc}
{It takes years of practice to make a good archer, but new recruits can be trained quickly to use a crossbow. While it's rate of fire is slower, this is offset by the crossbow's superior killing power and armor penetration. The secret to making a crossbow is the sophisticated bronze trigger mechanism.}
{Tech Chu ko nu}
{Chu Ko Nu}
{Tech Chu ko nu Desc}
{The Chu ko no is a repreating crossbow, particularly favored by peasants. The string is pulled back by hand, so each shot is rather weak, but the recocking motion loads another bolt, allowing a shot to be fired off every couple of seconds. It can be effective against unarmoured targets, but against armored troops, its effect is more disconcerting than lethal. Sometimes the bolts are tipped with poision to increase their effect.}
{Tech Flaming Pitch}

{Tech Beehive Rocket Launcher}
{Beehive Rocket Launcher}
{Tech Beehive Rocket Launcher Desc}
{Experiments with gunpowder have shown that burning powder alone is enough to shoot an arrow through the air without the need for a bow. There rockets are light so a single man may carry many in a bundle and launch them like a swarm of angry bees. Although rather inaccurate, they will cause great fear amongst the enemy, and not a little damage.}
{Tech Thunderclap Bomb}
{Thunderclap Bomb}
{Tech Thunderclap Bomb Desc}
{By filling an earthenware pot with gunpowder, a most effective projectile can be fashioned for engines to throw, that will explode on impact, affecting enemy over a wide area. Sharp spikes of iron, or shards of pottery contained within the top will cause a shower of deadly shrapnel further enhancing the deadly effect.}
{Tech Three Eyed Gun}
{Three Eyed Gun}
{Tech Three Eyed Gun Desc}
{If gunpowder is confined in a closed tube, and a lead ball that fills the tube completely placed atop it, the ball will be expelled with great force when the gunpowder explodes. The range of the ball is short, but it strikes with a lethal force far greater than any arrow. Three such tubes can be attached to a handle to create the three eyed gun.}

{Tech Calendar}
{Calendar}
{Tech Calendar Desc}
{The movement of the moon and stars mark the passage of time. By careful study of these, a calendar may be devised to divide time into years and months, and to determine when is the correct time to plant and harvest crops. Sadly the months marked by the phases of the moon, do not divide evenly into the year, so some years will have 12 months, and some 13.}
{Tech Astronomy}
{Astronomy}
{Tech Astronomy Desc}

{Tech Equal Temperament Scale}
{Equal Temperament  Scale}
{Tech Equal Temperament Scale Desc}
{Musical notes sound the most pleasant when the frequency of each is some fixed multiple of the one below it. If a note is double the frequencey of another, they are separated by one octave. Practical music requires the octave to be divided into a number of semitones, twelve being the most common, with the frequency of each note being a fixed ratio to the one below. This has long been recognized, but tuning instruments to this scheme has always involved much trial and error. Now there is a firm mathematical formula for how to do this.}
{Tech Ship Building}
{Ship Building}
{Tech Ship Building Desc}
{Constructing larger vessels that can transport armies, and cover great distances, requires mastery of many skills The shipwright must draw up a design that is light, yet strong enough to support its weight. Craftsman must cut wooden pieces accurately according to the design before they are assembled. Iron nails are needed to fasten the planks together, and caulking to make the ship watertight. Finally, oar mounts and rowing techniques must be developed for vessels where the rowers sit well above the waterline.}
{Tech Watertight Compartments}
{Watertight Compartments}
{Tech Watertight Compartments Desc}
{If watertight transverse bulkheads are placed across a ships hull, it is divided into multiple compartments. If one compartment is holed or leaks, the ship will not sink, and water from leaks can more easily be pumped out.
