{HPTitle Horde Settlements}
{Horde Settlements}
{HPHeading Horde Settlements 1}
{Introduction}
{HPText Horde Settlements 1}
{Horde settlements are a special type of settlement that can be moved around the map. Each horde settlement has an accompanying horde unit. If this unit is moved, the entire settlement is packed up and loaded onto the unit. If the unit finishes its movement on a hex where a settlement could normally be created, then the settlement is recreated on that spot.}
{HPText Horde Settlements 2}
{This mobility can be used defensively to move vulnerable settlements away from threatening enemies, or offensively by providing a travelling support base where you can replenish depleted units, and recruit new ones.}
{HPHeading Horde Settlements Creation}
{Creating a Horde Settlement}
{HPText Horde Settlements Creation 1}
{Horde settlements can only be created by herder factions that have the "Iron-Wheeled Carts" technology. They can be created in one of two ways. Firstly by recruiting a horde unit in an existing settlement, which effectively creates a new settlement that will be deployed  when the horde unit moves away to a suitable location.}
{HPText Horde Settlements Creation 2}
{The second way is to convert an existing settlement to a horde by building the "Town to Horde" settlement upgrade on the building screen. When completed, this will create a horde unit in the garrison, and the existing settlement with all its buildings and people will be attached to it. }
{HPText Horde Settlements Creation 3}
{A horde settlement can be turned back into a normal one using the button on the bottom right of the settlement screen. Convert it to a normal settlement first if you wish to disband it.}
{HPHeading Horde Settlements Restrictions}
{Restrictions}
{HPText Horde Settlements Restrictions}
{Horde settlements are not allowed to have any farms or external buildings, and some internal buildings are also prohibited. They can only be created from towns that do not yet have sufficient population to be upgraded to a city.}
{HPHeading Horde Settlement Attrition}
{Attrition}
{HPText Horde Settlement Attrition}
{A horde unit can only deploy its settlement in a location where a normal settlement could be founded. Therefore it can't deploy within the territory of, or too close to another settlement, adjacent to water etc. If a horde unit is unable to deploy its settlement, then it cannot produce any food, apart from two for domestic production. The population will eat any stored food, and then any flock animals they have. When these are exhausted they will suffer attrition due to starvation. Flock animals will also suffer attrition due to lack of grazing. However, the horde can make use of any food resource in or adjacent to their hex unless another settlement is already using it.}

{Peaceful Surrender}
{HPHeading Settlement Surrender Text 1}
{Sometimes a settlement will surrender peacefully at the start of a battle, or when an enemy unit reaches a breach.}
{HPHeading Settlement Surrender Text 2}
{This is most likely to occur when a barbarian faction employs terror tactics to intimidate the city. These include destroying nearby settlements, assaulting the settlement with driven civilians, or using terrifying incendiary weapons in the assault. A city may also surrender if totally surrounded and out of food. The number of skulls on top of the city tab give an indication of how likely the city is to surrender.}
{HPHeading Settlement Surrender Text 3}
