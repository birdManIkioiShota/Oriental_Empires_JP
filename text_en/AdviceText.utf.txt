{ADV_TEXT_Misc_003}
{The nobles like to be in control of their own areas, and resent interference by the central state. If they think the state is too weak to punish them, they will misbehave, and may even revolt.

The strength of the central state is measured by your Authority score shown in the bottom left corner. If you have more settlements than you have Authority, you risk unrest among the nobles. In practice its usually safe to exceed your Authority by one or two, especially early in the game.}
{ADV_TITLE_Misc_004}
{Character}
{ADV_TEXT_Misc_004}
{You always have at least one, and usually more named characters to control, one of which is your faction leader (king or emperor). They have two rating that may vary over the course of the game, and they will also age and eventually die.

Characters can be used to lead armies, or quell unrest in cities. They can also be used exploit the various opportunities offered by the orange encounter markers. You can enlist more characters by issuing edicts.}
{ADV_TITLE_Misc_005}
{Manage Your Money}
{ADV_TEXT_Misc_005}
{The key to a successful game is managing your finances. Remember that both units and buildings have an upkeep cost, so you should only build or recruit what you need, rather than everything you can.

However, make sure you have enough military units, that you don't look weak and invite attack.

Growing your population by developing agriculture, and getting a good trade network going is the key to a strong economy.

{ADV_TITLE_Misc_007}
{Herding}
{ADV_TEXT_Misc_007}
{You don't need farms to survive, but it is difficult to create settlements larger than towns due to the low population density supported by herding.

{ADV_TITLE_Misc_009}
{Farmers}
{ADV_TEXT_Misc_009}

{ADV_TEXT_SET_015}
{New settlements have very little labor available. If you order them to construct farms, buildings or anything else, there will be no-one to farm, and the population will not increase. If all the figures at the bottom of the screen are blue, then everyone is building, and no-one is farming.}

{ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Shang03}
{It is time to think about recruiting another settler and starting a new settlement. 

A settlement to the south or east near the river will give you the later opportunity to trade along the river, and to build a fleet to prevent your enemies from crossing. 

On the other hand, a settlement to the West would be less vulnerable to attack, and would be especially valuable if you located any minerals to mine in the mountains.}
{ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Han01}
{ご挨拶}
{ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Han01}
{You are located on the flood plain of the Yellow River. There is ample good land to settle and farm, but there are enemies close by to the  East and West so it is important to stake out your claim to the land quickly. 

I advise taking your settler unit and founding a new settlement about 8 to 10 hexes away.  If you can place your settlement within three hexes of a Rhinoceros, Fish, or Wild Game resource, you will be able to exploit it for extra income or food.}

{ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Han02}

A settlement to the north or east near the river will give you the later opportunity to trade along the river, and to build a fleet to prevent your enemies from crossing. You might even consider settling across the river. This will open new opportunities, but may invite conflict with powers to the north.

On the other hand, a settlement to the West might be able to exploit any minerals you've located in the mountains there.}
