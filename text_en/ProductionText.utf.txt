Secondly, when your faction leader dies, a new one will be appointed. However, to represent the uncertainty of succession, his Authority will be temporarily reduced. This will be a time of danger for your empire when revolts are more likely to occur.}
{LDR Faction Heir Text}
{This character is your faction's heir. When your faction leader dies, he will become the new leader. When he succeeds, his Authority will be temporarily reduced, but not by too much. The heir's personal Authority rating has no direct effect, until he becomes faction leader.
If the heir dies, a new one will be appointed after a period of time. If the faction leader dies while there is no heir, the new leader's Authority will be reduced much more severely.}
{LDR Top General Text}
{This character is multi-talented, and will excel at either leading armies, or governing settlements.}
{LDR Best As Governor Text}
{This man is mainly noted for his virtue. His example will inspire his men to fight longer in battle, but not harder. He will be most effectively used to reduce unrest as governor of a city.}
{LDR Best As General Text}
{This man is mainly noted for his energy and martial prowess. He is best used to lead an army, which will fight better under his leadership. He may be placed as governor of a city, but will contribute little in that role.}
{LDR Poor Leader Text}
{This man has little to commend him, being listless and lacking moral strength. Maybe a spell on the frontlines will improve his character.}
{LDR Generic Leader Text}
{You can use this character to either lead an army, or to govern a city (by placing him in the garrison stack). His qi rating will improve the fighting ability of any troops he commands, and his ren rating will reduce unrest in the city he governs.}
{LDR Other Player Character}
{Know your enemy, as you know yourself.}

{Edicts are laws and regulations issued by the king or emperor. Edicts have a variety of effects, but many cause some short term unhappiness while people adjust. 
You may issue only one edict per turn. Generally this will remain in effect until cancelled (though a few edicts may not be cancelled, or auto expire after a set number of turns) .Cancelling edicts will also have effects. These vary, but most commonly your authority will be reduced for looking weak or indecisive. However, you can generally cancel an edict the turn it was issued, allowing you to check its effect on your empire.}

{UI Authority Description}
{Authority represents the respect that local leaders have for the central state. It encompases both the fear of retribution for disobedience, and the belief that a central state is necessary and desirable. Your authority determines the number of settlements you can directly control. If you have more settlements than your authority rating then all your settlements will suffer increased noble unrest. Authority will be temporarily reduced when a new faction leader takes over, making this a period of danger. Authority doesn't affect peasant unrest.}
{UI Culture Description}
{Culture represents that state of advance of your state, and the degree to which your people voluntarily associate with it. Culture reduces unrest among both peasants and nobles, but affects the nobles more. Culture comes from advances in the Technology and Culture tree, but can also be boosted by certain edicts.}
{UI Culture Trade Benefit}
{Culture also affects trade. The value of silk, ceramics and local specialties is increased by {0}% if exporting to another power with lower culture, and corresponding reduced if exporting to one with a higher culture.}

{Raw military might is an argument that can only be answered in kind. When none remain who can oppose your argument, then none can doubt your supremacy. You can win a Conquest Victory by controlling {0:d0}% of the total game population. Population controlled by your vassals counts as under your control.}
{UI Culture Victory Text}
{While conquerors can shape the world for a time, ideas and culture have a more lasting influence. If you can establish your faction as the cultural driving force of the area, then history will consider it the most important of its time. To win a Cultural Victory, you must amass {0:d0} culture victory points and have {1:d}% more points than the second highest player. Your culture victory points are the sum of your culture rating, and all culture victory points from buildings that you have constructed or captured. Palaces, temples, shrines and other buildings provide culture victory points.}
{UI Glory Victory Text}
{Sometimes many factions can co-exist without any one clearly dominating. Deciding which was most important or successful means weighing their size, influence, and cultural achievements. If the game ends without any player winning by another victory condition, then the victor is the player with the highest victory score. This is calculated based on both the cultural victory points, the amount of population controlled directly, or by vassals, and by the population who recognize the faction's leader as emperor.}
{UI SOH Victory Text}
{When you are widely recognized as the Son of Heaven and rightful Emperor, then none can doubt your legitimacy of your rule. You win a Son of Heaven Victory when {0:d0}% of the game's population recognize you as Emperor. Your own population, that of your vassals, and that of the players who recognize you as Emperor count towards this total.}

{BD Armor Works Desc}
{With a small group of skilled artisans directing a less skilled workforce, the armor works can turn out sufficient quantities of leather or light armor to equip all militia troops, and enough light metallic armor for all trained soldiers.}
{BD Armor Factory Desc}
{Armor production on an industrial scale can supply enough quality metal armor for all trained soldiers. It can also produce large quantities of lighter armor, so that even militia troops can have metal armor.}
{BD Foundry Desc}
{The foundry is the place where raw ores are turned into useful bronze. Bronze can be used for many tools and ceremonial objects, and can be traded to neighboring settlements. A steady supply of quality metal is also needed for production of advanced weapons and armor.}
{BD Iron Foundry Desc}
{The Iron Foundry includes the hot furnaces required for the large scale production of iron. Once the technology is in place, iron is far cheaper than bronze, providing more value to the local economy, and ultimately fetching more in trade due to the wider range of uses for it. A steady supply of steel is also needed for certain advanced weapons and armors. }
{Zhou Desc}
{The Zhou are a tough Chinese people in the Wei River valley to the west. Their rulers have a reputation as wise sage kings, and are renowned for their skill at chariot warfare. Historically, they overthrew the decadent Shang and formed the third, and longest lived, great dynasty. They were the first to claim the mandate of Heaven, a claim to legitimacy used by all subsequent dynasties.}
{Wu Desc}
{Wu occupies the area around the mouth of the Yangtze River. It's rulers are Chinese, but the people engage in practices considered somewhat barbarous, such as tattooing and cutting hair. They are skilled with boats and ships, and are particularly skilled at making swords. Although their land is bountiful, it is unsuitable for horse rearing.
Historically the original kingdom of Wu was destroyed by Min, but the name was used by several later states, most notably during the famous Three Kingdoms period.}

{These paddle wheel boats are the fastest way to move troops along the great rivers. Instead of vulnerable oars, they have paddle wheels operated by men on treadles. This makes more efficient use of human energy, and allows tired men to be more easily replaced by fresh ones. Although they can be used in coastal waters, the paddle wheels do not work as well on the rougher sea.}

{HPText Battle Plans Charge New}
{Immediately move to attack the enemy by melee attack, without forming into battle line. This plan is useful to force units with missile weapons to attack in hand to hand combat;  to attack quickly before the enemy can withdraw, or receive reinforcements; or to disrupt the formation of the enemy's battle line. Units with the charge plan suffer a small defense penalty against both missile and melee attacks.}
{HPText Battle Plans Attack New}
{Form up into a battle line then, advance to attack the enemy using either missiles or hand to hand combat. If other units are performing harass or outflank plans, then delay the attack to allow those plans to take effect. The attack may also be delayed if at least half the front rank units of the battle line have missiles, or the battle line has more missiles than the opposing enemy.}
{HPText Battle Plans Harass New 1}
{Advance on the enemy without forming into battle line.  Prefer shooting and only attack in melee combat in advantageous circumstances.  Missile armed cavalry and chariot units, and foot units entirely armed with missiles will skirmish away from threatening enemy. }
{HPText Battle Plans Harass New 2}
{This plan is useful for missile armed cavalry to wear down the enemy with missile fire;   to send infantry missile units forward to shoot up the enemy while forming up, or to counter enemy doing the same. Another use is to prevent units in small adjacent stacks, from being integrated into the battle line, and disrupted the unit arrangement.}
{HPText Battle Plans Outflank New}
{Attempt to work around the enemy's flank, before launching an attack. Do not form up in the battle line. This is useful if you outnumber the enemy, or they are in a favorable position.}
{HPText Battle Plans Ambush New 1}
{Stay hidden until an opportunity arises to attack the enemy in flank or rear. When ambushing units reveal themselves, they change to an attack or harass battle plan.}
{HPText Battle Plans Ambush New 2}
{The ambush battle plan is only effective if the unit is in forest terrain.  In other terrain it will be treated as having a ���Support��� or ���Harass��� battle plan, depending on whether or not it has missiles.}
{HPText Battle Plans Ambush New 3}
{If all units in a stack have the ambush battle plan, and the stack is in a forest hex, then that stack will be invisible to other players unless they have a stack immediately adjacent. If a stack starts hidden, a battle will not be triggered by moving adjacent to it.}
{HPText Battle Plans Defend New 1}
{Form up in a battle line, and await the enemy attack. Hold position until melee combat begins, and then only attack enemy who are very close. Receive a small bonus to defense against both missile and melee attacks.}
{HPText Battle Plans Defend New 2}
{The defend plan is useful when there is terrain to defend; to maximize missile fire against an enemy of largely melee units;  to keep particular units out of battle for as long as possible;  for infantry to best resist a force of horse archers; to await reinforcements, or to provide a rear guard to allow withdrawing units to escape.}
{HPText Battle Plans Defend New 3}
{It can be dangerous to use against an enemy with numerous missile troops that could be engaged in melee, or in complex multi-force battles where units with the defend plan might ignore enemy in other parts of the battlefield.}
{HPHead Battle Plans Support}
{Support}
{HPText Battle Plans Support 1}
{Form up into the battle line, but only engage enemy units that are very close, or that are attacking friendly units.  Chariots and cavalry with missiles, and foot units entirely armed with missiles can skirmish away from enemy provided that they have a nearby friendly unit to retreat behind.}
{HPText Battle Plans Support 2}
{This is useful to allow missile units to be placed in the front line of a formation, while still being able to retreat to safety when the battle lines clash, and to keep the second line of a formation in place to protect against breakthroughs or attacks from flank or rear.}
{HPText Battle Plans Withdraw New}
{Move towards the edge of the battlefield, and do not engage any enemy. If not in combat when half the battle time has elapsed, withdraw from the battle. Useful  for settler and moving artillery units, or to ensure the safety of a valuable unit.  For units to be able to withdraw successfully, there needs to be a rearguard left behind to delay the enemy.}
{HPText Battle Plans Intro 1 New}
{During your turn you may assign a battle plans to each unit, that determines how it behaves in battle. By default it is set to attack, which is fine for most situations, but for important battles you may want to fine tune your tactics. If you set a defensive plan (ambush, defend, support or withdraw) for all units in a stack, it will stop when encountering enemy, rather than initiating a battle.}
{HPText Battle Plans Intro 3 New}
{In siege battles, units with "charge" battle plans are used preferentially for assaults, followed by those with "attack" plans. Units with "defend" plans are least likely to be used, and those with "withdraw" plans won't be used at all.}
{HPHead Battle Lines}
{Battle Lines}
{HPText Battle Lines 1}
{In open field battles units will generally form up into opposing battle lines before engaging. Stacks that start the battle close together will form into the same battle line, but widely separated forces will form their own lines. Armies never form battle lines in siege battles, and may not in very small battles.}
{HPText Battle Lines 2}
{A battle line may be either offensive or defensive. A line is offensive if at least one unit has an "Attack" battle plan, otherwise it is defensive. }
{HPText Battle Lines 3}
{A defensive line will wait for the enemy to attack, however it may adjust its position to defend a slope or river bank.}
{HPText Battle Lines 4}
{An offensive battle line will form up and advance on the enemy to engage them in combat. However if it may first halt within missile range if it has more missile troops than the enemy;  if half or more of the units in the front line have missiles, or if units in the army have ���outflank��� or ���harass��� battle plans.}

{Grand Campaign Desc}
{The Grand Campaign presents a grand tour through the development of Chinese Civilization starting from the earliest recorded times, until the widespread adoption of gunpowder weapons (approx. 1500 BC to 1500 AD). Players start with a single town, and must guide their kingdom to hegemony. It is recommended that new players start with this scenario, as it contains a wealth of hints and useful advice.}
{Warring States 407 Desc}
{This scenario is based on the historical situation around 407 BC early in the Warring States period of history. Each faction has already advanced to the Warring States era, and major factions control several settlements, with some infrastructure already constructed. The rate of technological development is reduced compared to the standard game. There is still considerable room for players to expand, but early conflict is likely for most factions.}
{Custom Game Desc}
{A custom game creates a random world for you to play in. You can control the size and style of the map created, and the number of factions present. Each player begins with just one settlement. It is recommended particularly for multiplayer games, or for players wanting a smaller quicker game.}

{Zhao Full}
{Zhao}
{Zhao Desc}
{Zhao is known as one of the three Jins, the states that broke away from the ancient state of Jin, and because of this will always be embroiled in the complicated politics of the North China Plain. Culturally, there is little to distinguish from it's Chinese neighbors, except that it serves as a conduit for culture from the steppe barbarians to the north. Eventually, Zhao reformed its army to incorporate the horse archery tactics of its barbarian neighbors, and became one of the strongest kingdoms of the Warring States Era.

{Song WS Desc}
{When king Wu of Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, he was honor bound to ensure that the spirits of their previous kings would still receive sacrifices from their descendants This eventually led to the Shang king's estranged brother being enfiefed as the Duke of Song at Shangqiu. Although only a medium sized state, Song is a frequent participant in the wars of Northern China. Duke Xiang is infamous for considering it unsporting to attack an enemy army while it was crossing a river, which lead to his defeat and death. Some see him as a fool, others as the last remnant of a bygone era.}

{Zheng Desc}
{The state of Zheng was founded by a cadet branch of the royal house of Zhou. It's position just to the south of the Yellow river, right in the center of the North China Plain, makes it a nexus for trade, giving it the wealth to be more powerful than its limited territory would suggest. Although the first state to adopt a formal code of laws, it is socially conservative, still practicing human sacrifice in burials.}

{Lu}
{Lu Desc}
{The state of Lu was founded by the King of Zhou's brother the Duke of Zhou soon after their overthrow of Shang, in order to project their power eastwards. Initially it was a strong state, but controlling only a small territory, it became overshadowed by more powerful neighbors. It is mainly famous as the birthplace of Confucius, who often used the Duke of Zhou as an exemplar of a virtuous ruler. The famous Annals of Spring and Autumn are an account of events as seen from Lu spanning more than 200 years.}

{Qi is a prosperous well organized state in the East of China. It is rich from taxes on trade, and monopolies on various goods and services, including state licensed brothels. It's rulers are cultured and sponsor the Jixia Academy that attracts many noted scholars. However, they are often regarded as arrogant and uncaring of the common people. Qi's armies are numerous, and favor shock combat, but there are few incentives for the common soldier, leading to a general lack of enthusiasm and effectiveness.

{The Dong Hu, whose name comes from the Chinese term meaning eastern barbarians, are a confederation of tribes living in Manchuria and eastern Mongolia. They practice both nomadic animal husbandry and agriculture. They excel in cavalry tactics, and are also skilled craftsmen. Later descendants of theirs became the Xianbei, Khitans, and Mongols.}
{Qin WS Desc}
{The Qin started as a small fiefdom at the periphery of Chinese civilization, but following barbarian incursions that drove the Zhou from the West, they have expanded to control most of the Wei river valley. This region, the land between the passes, is quite secure being accessible by only a few easily defended paths, and offers them an excellent base to build the strength needed to conquer the whole of China. The Qin are well organized and ruthlessly warlike, if a little uncultured. Historically they could be considered the winners of this scenario, as their leader King Zheng conquered all the other Chinese states and assumed the title of "Shi Huangdi" or "First Emperor.}
{Zhou WS Desc}
{The Zhou are the nominal feudal overlords of all the Chinese states, dating back to the time when they overthrew the Shang dynasty. However, several hundred years ago, they were driven from their homeland in the West by Rong barbarians, and now control only a small area around their eastern capital. Many see their former rule as a golden era, and they still enjoy a certain lingering prestige, but any suzerainty over the other states is now purely nominal, and most are far more powerful than Zhou.}
{Han WS Desc}
{The Han are one of the three Jins, the states that broke away from that formerly large state. Their power base is south of the Yellow River, but they also have lands to the north, making their position complicated, and difficult to defend.

{Shu WS Desc}
{The Shu are located in the Sichuan basin in the far west, with their capital Chengdu almost in the foothills of the Tibetan Plateau They are a well organized people, whose state and civilization arose separately from that of the rest of China. They have many expert craftsmen, and extensive trade networks, but apart from the occasional clash, are isolated from the politics and wars of the North and East.}
{Crossbow Militia}
{Peasant Crossbows}
{Crossbow Militia Desc}
{A crossbow is easy to use, but packs a heavy punch, making it ideal for militia troops with only a little training. However, the complex trigger mechanism is complex to make, so only a nation with a wealth of skilled craftsmen can field such a unit.}
{Heavy Spear Militia}
{Peasant Heavy Spearmen}
{Heavy Spear Militia Desc}
{Although armor is expensive, a wooden shield is cheap enough that most peasants can afford to equip themselves with one. It offers good protection against missiles, and combined with a long spear allows them to fend off must better trained of equipped opponents.}
{Horse Archer Militia}
{Peasant Horse Archers}
{Horse Archer Militia Desc}
{In the lands of northern China close to Mongolia, horses are in more plentiful supply than else where, and many farmers can afford one. Following royal instructions, they have copied the dress and equipment of the neighboring barbarians, allowing them to form a militia better suited to combating the incursions of their opponents.}

{ED Ride Like a Barbarian Desc}
{Our lands are constantly menaced by barbarians who ride swift as the wind on their sturdy horses. They easily evade us as we chase after them in our clumsy chariots, and when we do ride horses we are hampered by the unsuitable court clothing we wear. Therefore let us learn form these people, and have our soldiers adopt their dress and equipment, so that we can form an effective cavalry force to combat them.}

{WS Advice Yan}
{Your realm is a strip of land between the mountains to the North, and the Yellow Sea.to the South. Although your land is not extensive, your cities are large and prosperous.

Beyond the mountains are the Dong Hu barbarians, who you will have to deal with if you are to survive. If you can drive them away from your core cities and establish some outposts to protect against their raids, then you will have a secure position.

To the West and South are the large states of Zhao and Qi, and the smaller one of Zhongshan. While getting involved in the complicated alliances of Northern China may become an expensive entanglement, an ambitious ruler will monitor the situation and look for opportunities to expand his territories when his neighbors are weak.

The land to the East is mainly uninhabited, and offers an excellent opportunity to expand your kingdom. However there are many forests to clear, and marshes to drain, so turning the area into productive land will take some time.}
{WS Advice Qi}
{Your state is located in the east of the North China plain, in the area of Shandong. Your lands are not large, but they are very productive, and your cities are rich from trade.

Many states are vying for control of the plains, and you will need to keep a close eye on the shifting alliances, and stop any one of them becoming too powerful. Bear in mind that too much war is bad for trade.

There is some room to expand to the North, but frequent flooding of the Yellow River will be troublesome. The small state of Lu to the South is ripe for capture, and it may also be possible take territory from the extensive but relatively weak state of Yue also to the South.}
{WS Advice Zhao}
{Your realm is located along the Fen River just to the north of the Yellow River flood plain. Handan, your largest city is right in the center of the North China Plain, meaning that you will easily become embroiled in the complicated politics and wars of that region.

However, your kingdom has great potential for expansion to the north and to the west, provided that you can protect your settlers from the barbarians coming down from the Mongolian steppes.

As Zhao, you have the unique ability to reform your military (by issuing an edict) to adopt the horse archer tactics of the steppe peoples. This will aid you in your battles against them, and may also give you an edge over your Chinese rivals.}
{WS Advice Wei}
{Your state has emerged from the break up of the ancient state of Jin, and as such its holdings are scattered and somewhat intermixed with the other break-away states. Your central position, mean that you are surrounded by many powerful neighbors, but there are also smaller states that you might annex.

Wars are inevitable, but if you can make peace with at least some of your rivals, then there are uninhabited lands that you can settle, and turn your state into a stronger more cohesive realm.

While your central position is challenging, with skillful diplomacy, you can set your neighbors against each other, and benefit from their misfortunes.}
{WS Advice Yue}
{Your state was originally founded south of  the Yangtze river, but recently conquered the state of Wu, and expanded to control the area around the mouth of the Yangtze River. Filled with ambition you recently moved your capital far to the north as a springboard for further expansion. Defending this position may be difficult, and you may need to abandon it and concentrate on your core territory. 

Your lands are quite extensive, but they are sparsely populated, and your settlements scattered, leaving you vulnerable to attack by more powerful neighbors. Therefore, your immediate goals should be to secure peace with the surrounding states, while you consolidate and strengthen your realm.

You are well positioned to create a lucrative water borne trade empire, with trade routes running along the coast and along the major rivers.}
{WS Advice Qin}
{You enjoy a secure position along  the Wei river valley, which is only accessible by a few easily defended routes. The barbarians to the west and north are the most likely to give you trouble.

You have some of room to expand within your own territories, and plenty of potential to expand to the South, and you should consider trying to conquer the state of Shu and annex its territory. To the East are many powerful states, who will often be fighting each other. Look for opportunities to expand here when they are preoccupied with each other.}
{WS Advice Han}
{Your territory is rather scattered, with settlements both north and south of the Yellow River. Holding on to everything may be a challenge, so you should avoid a two front war and do whatever it takes to secure peace with either the Northern or Southern neighbors.

There is some room for expansion both north and south of the river, with the south perhaps being a little better. There are also the small states of Zhou and Zheng that you could conquer. However, beware of Chu to your south, as they have relatively few targets other than Han.}
{WS Advice Chu}
{You start in control of a large swathe of territory on the north bank of the Yangtze River. On paper you are wealthy and powerful, but your cities are far apart. Individually, none of your neighbors is a match for you, but given the distances involved, fighting two at once could be difficult. You have much empty territory to exploit, so it might be wise to concentrate on internal development for a while, and let others waste their strength fighting.

Your capital is on the banks of the Yangtze river. Consider exploiting this waterway as highway for movement, and a route for trade. It's also a route you can use to attack Shu and Ba to the West, and Yue to the East.}
{WS Advice Shu}
{You start far to the West in the Sichuan basin, away from most of the other great powers. Compared to those you are relatively weak, but have plenty of space to develop and grow. Your biggest danger is Qin to the north, so try to secure peace with them until you are strong enough to fight.

The state of Ba is your natural rival for domination of Sichuan, and some conflict with them is probably inevitable. }
{WS Advice Ba}
{You start in the south of China with a state that straddles the middle reaches of the Yangtze river. Your main avenues for expansion are to the South and to the West. The land to the South is uninhabited and undeveloped, but there are many forests to clear and marshes to drain before you can build great cities. Sichuan, the land to the west is more promising, but will bring you into conflict with Shu and Qin.

Initially you are one of the weaker powers, and so should avoid conflict. However, you need to prepared to assert yourself against Shu to claim your share of Sichuan.}
{WS Advice ZhongShan}
{You are a small state in northern China, surrounded by more powerful ones. Survival should be your main priority to begin with. Given your small starting territory, any war could be devastating, but may be difficult to avoid since you are tempting target for larger states looking to expand. Try to secure some powerful allies, or consider becoming a vassal to one of your neighbors.

If you can survive, there is space to expand into to the East around the mouth of the Yellow river, and to the North. Expanding east is easier, but is a high risk strategy, and will expose you to both hostile attacks and frequent flooding. Moving north will expose you to the Xiongnu and Dong Hu, but these have plenty of land available, so you may be able to buy them off.}
{WS Advice Jin}
{Your once mighty state is now reduced to a single city near the Fen river. The neighboring states of Wei, Zhao and Han will be looking to swallow you up, so only some shrewd diplomacy will let you survive. There is space available to the west for expansion, but that will likely make you a target for Qin.

All in all, your position is extremely difficult, and survival  should be seen as an achievement in itself.}
{WS Advice Zheng}
{You begin as a single city state to the south of the Yellow River. Although many of the surrounding states are more powerful, your city is well fortified and rich, so you are no pushover. There is some land around that you can use to expand, but you'll need careful diplomacy to defend your new settlements.

Although playing off your neighbors against each other may seem like the thing to do, much of your wealth comes from trade, and war is bad for business, even if you're not directly involved.}
{WS Advice Zhou}
{Your state was once the overlord of all China, but is now reduced to a single city just south of the Yellow River. Restoring Zhou to its former glory will be a mammoth task, that will require great skill to achieve. However, your remaining city is rich and strong, so there is some hope.

The nearby powers of Han and Wei will see you as a tempting target, so your priority should be to secure good relations with them. This will allow you to expand into the surrounding empty lands and become stronger. However, scope for expansion is limited, so you will need to fight to expand further, and for that you will need allies. If you make the right alliances you will prosper, if not you will be extinguished.}
{WS Advice Song}
{You start as a medium sized power, on the south side of the Yellow River. Your immediate neighbors are smaller states that may look like tempting targets to annex, but beware of them allying themselves with stronger powers. As ever with the smaller states, diplomacy will be the key to advancement.

You have some possibilities to expand your land, especially to the south. Also try to exploit your central position and access to the Yellow River to build a lucrative trade network.}
{WS Advice Lu}
{Lu is a small state near the coast to the south of the Shandong Peninsula. All the surrounding powers are much stronger, and will be looking to gobble you up, particularly the powerful state of Qi to your north. You will need to ally with some of your neighbors to survive, and it may be necessary to become a vassal of one of them.

There is some limited space to expand, but holding a larger territory will be difficult. Expanding militarily will require joining in the wars of larger powers. Carefully picking the winning side will be key.}
{WS Advice Xianbei}
{You play as a nomadic herding faction to the north. Currently there are no imminent threats, but you are quite weak and need to spread out and grow. There is limited space on the steppes to the far north, as the Dong Hu will block your progress, but there is plenty of room to expand in the big loop of the Yellow River to the south.

You are not in close contact with the any of the farming states, who lay mostly to the south and east, but the mobility of your light cavalry will let you form raiding parties with little fear of reprisals. This is a good way to raise money, which will otherwise be in short supply.}
{WS Advice Dong Hu}
{You are unusual in that you have a mixed economy, combining both nomadic herdsmen  and settled farmers. This gives you options to exploit all the land around you. In the long run, farming on the fertile plains will be more lucrative, but farms are also harder to protect, so also make sure to have a few settlements of herders in the grassland to the north.

You start next to several farming states, and raiding them for loot can be a good extra source of income. However, try to spread the damage you do equally, lest any one of them become too strong. In particular beware the state of Yan to your south, it will likely defeat you in a full scale war.}
{WS Advice Dog Rong}
{Your faction is a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes spread thinly across the western part of the map. Your confederation is weak and divided, but its remote location is its protection, and you have ample room to expand and grow stronger.

The lands in the west are not the best, but some small settlements here will be well protected from enemies, and you may be able to exploit reserves of gold or jade in the mountains. To the north east is a large area of grassland, that offers great opportunities for expansion. There are also opportunities in Sichuan to the south, particularly when the state of Shu is weak.}

If you wish to use your own map, you should create it first before entering the scenario editor, since once you create a scenario, you can���t change the map it���s based on. You can still edit that map though.}
