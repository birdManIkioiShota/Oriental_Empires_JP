ADV_TITLE_Misc_005,Manage Your Money

ADV_TITLE_Misc_007,Herding
ADV_TEXT_Misc_007,"You don't need farms to survive, but it is difficult to create settlements larger than towns due to the low population density supported by herding.

To become a great power, you will need some cities. You can either research agriculture yourself, and develop a mixed economy, or conquer them from the farming factions."
ADV_TITLE_Misc_009,Farmers
ADV_TEXT_Misc_009,"You are playing a farming faction. The key to your power is developing extensive farmlands and a large population. Be sure to continually build farms around your settlements to allow the population to grow.

ADV_TEXT_SET_015,"New settlements have very little labor available. If you order them to construct farms, buildings or anything else, there will be no-one to farm, and the population will not increase.

ADV_TITLE_Armies_013,Unit Replenishment
ADV_TEXT_Armies_013,"A unit can replenish its losses by moving to the territory of a friendly settlement that can recruit units of that recruitment type (militia, nobles, palace etc). A green indicator at the top of the unit card will show when its strength is being replenished."

ADV_TITLE_GENGHIS_002,Horde Attrition
ADV_TEXT_GENGHIS_002,"Your horde unit cannot deploy its settlement here, and may suffer losses to its people and flocks. Try to move to one of the indicated hexes where a settlement may be deployed."
ADV_TITLE_GENGHIS_003,Horde Support
ADV_TEXT_GENGHIS_003,A horde settlement can advance with your armies and provide a convenient place to replenish depleted units. If deployed it replenishes units in the same way as a normal settlement.
ADV_TITLE_GENGHIS_004,Convert to Horde
ADV_TEXT_GENGHIS_004,"You can convert this settlement to a horde and move it to a more favourable, or less threatened location."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Shang01,Greetings
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Shang01,"You are located on the flood plain of the Yellow River. There is ample good land to settle and farm, but there are enemies close by to the North, East and South, so it is important to stake out your claim to the land quickly. 

I advise taking your settler unit and founding a new settlement about 8 to 10 hexes away. If you can place your settlement within three hexes of a Rhinoceros, Fish, or Wild Game resource, you will be able to exploit it for extra income or food."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Shang02,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Shang02,"If you haven't already, it might be a good idea to recruit another settler unit in Yin, and send it out to claim more land while it is still uncontested.

Also be sure to use your characters to explore the map and check out the yellow map encounter opportunities."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Shang03,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Shang03,"It is time to think about recruiting another settler and starting a new settlement. 

A settlement to the south or east near the river will give you the later opportunity to trade along the river, and to build a fleet to prevent your enemies from crossing. 

On the other hand, a settlement to the West would be less vulnerable to attack, and would be especially valuable if you located any minerals to mine in the mountains."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Han01,Greetings
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Han01,"You are located on the flood plain of the Yellow River. There is ample good land to settle and farm, but there are enemies close by to the  East and West so it is important to stake out your claim to the land quickly.

ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Han02,"If you haven't already, it might be a good idea to recruit another settler unit in Zheng and send it out to claim more land while it is still uncontested.

ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Han03,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Han03,"It is time to think about recruiting another settler and starting a new settlement. 

A settlement to the north or east near the river will give you the later opportunity to trade along the river, and to build a fleet to prevent your enemies from crossing. You might even consider settling across the river. This will open new opportunities, but may invite conflict with powers to the north.

On the other hand, a settlement to the West might be able to exploit any minerals you've located in the mountains there."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Chu01,Greetings
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Chu01,"It's important to spread out quickly and stake out your territory, so send your settler unit out to start a new settlement. 

You have two main choices, settle to the east where there is lots of excellent farmland, but also dangerous enemies, or explore the mountainous area to the west, and build an economy based on exploiting whatever minerals you can find there.

If you can place your settlement within three hexes of a Rhinoceros, Fish, or Wild Game resource, you will be able to exploit it for extra income or food."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Chu02,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Chu02,"If you haven't already, it might be a good idea to recruit another settler unit in Danyang and send it out to claim more land while it is still uncontested.

ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Chu03,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Chu03,"It is time to think about recruiting another settler and starting a new settlement. 

Pushing south will eventually lead you to the great Yangtze river. While there is much land to be cleared to enable sizable settlements there, in the long term domination of the river would be very beneficial.

Alternatively, try to find a fertile area to the south east to create a farming settlement.
"
ADV_TITLE_C_GCZhou01,Greetings
ADV_TEXT_C_GCZhou01,"You are located in the ""land between the passes"", a fertile river valley surrounded by mountains. By quickly dominating this space, you can form a solid base for wider conquests.

The only nearby rival is the to the west. You might consider placing you first settlement just to the west to block, them, but there are better spots further east along the river.

Whichever direction you choose, if you can place your settlement within three hexes of a Rhinoceros, Fish, or Wild Game resource, you will be able to exploit it for extra income or food."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Zhou02,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Zhou02,"If you haven't already, it might be a good idea to recruit another settler unit in Fengjing and send it out to claim more land while it is still uncontested.

Also be sure to use your characters to explore the map and check out the yellow map encounter opportunities."
ADV_TITLE_C_GC_Zhou03,A Suggestion
ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Zhou03,"It is time to think about recruiting another settler and starting a new settlement. 

The most promising lands for cultivation are to the east, but spots to the north or south of the river might give you access valuable minerals.

Your main rival for the ""land between the passes"" are the Qin to the west, but they are quite weak to begin with. It might also be wise to scout out the mountain passes to the south so that you can block any threat from that direction. 
"
ADV_TITLE_C_GCShu01,Greetings
ADV_TEXT_C_GCShu01,"You are located in Sichuan, a fertile plain surrounded by mountains. Your main threats are from the north and the south east.

I would advise taking your settler unit and settling a little way to east, to protect your capital against any attack from that direction. After that, I suggest expanding into the unoccupied land to the south and west.

The best place to find more farmland is to the east along the river, just past the mountains, however, founding a settlement there does risk an early conflict.

There are potential settlement sites to the north and south too, but they are several turns distant from your capital. Make sure any attempt to settle them has a strong military escort."

ADV_TEXT_C_GC_Qin02,"Since your land is limited, I advise prioritizing agricultural technologies in your research. 

Try to be at peace with your neighbors, but don't show any weakness that might invite attack. It might be necessary to become a vassal to one or other for a while in order to survive.

Your immediate position is very weak, with little land available to settle. However, the land to the south is vast and unclaimed. It will take many turns to clear it, but you have the potential to become a great power towards the end of the game.

The only immediately viable settlement site is just across the river. There are some other small clearings along the rivers and coast, but you will have to explore a long way to find them."

Whenever this unit stops at a site suitable to found a settlement, one is automatically created with all the buildings and people it previously had. When this unit moves, the settlement is removed and replaced at the horde's new position. If the unit cannot create a settlement at the end of  the turn, its population and flocks will decline due to lack of food."

IT Militia Swordsmen,Peasant Militia Swordsmen
IT Militia Swordsmen Desc,"Armed with sharp scimitars, these men excel in close-in fighting. Enemy units with spears and halberds may hold them at bay for a while, but eventually the swordsmen will force their way through the enemy spear wall, and engage in some close range butchery.

HPTitle Horde Settlements,Horde Settlements
HPHeading Horde Settlements 1,Introduction
HPText Horde Settlements 1,"Horde settlements are a special type of settlement that can be moved around the map. Each horde settlement has an accompanying horde unit. If this unit is moved, the entire settlement is packed up and loaded onto the unit. If the unit finishes its movement on a hex where a settlement could normally be created, then the settlement is recreated on that spot."
HPText Horde Settlements 2,"This mobility can be used defensively to move vulnerable settlements away from threatening enemies, or offensively by providing a travelling support base where you can replenish depleted units, and recruit new ones."
HPHeading Horde Settlements Creation,Creating a Horde Settlement
HPText Horde Settlements Creation 1,"Horde settlements can only be created by herder factions that have the ""Iron-Wheeled Carts"" technology. They can be created in one of two ways. Firstly by recruiting a horde unit in an existing settlement, which effectively creates a new settlement that will be deployed  when the horde unit moves away to a suitable location."
HPText Horde Settlements Creation 2,"The second way is to convert an existing settlement to a horde by building the ""Town to Horde"" settlement upgrade on the building screen. When completed, this will create a horde unit in the garrison, and the existing settlement with all its buildings and people will be attached to it. "
HPText Horde Settlements Creation 3,A horde settlement can be turned back into a normal one using the button on the bottom right of the settlement screen. Convert it to a normal settlement first if you wish to disband it.
HPHeading Horde Settlements Restrictions,Restrictions

HPHeading Horde Settlement Attrition,Attrition
HPText Horde Settlement Attrition,"A horde unit can only deploy its settlement in a location where a normal settlement could be founded. Therefore it can't deploy within the territory of, or too close to another settlement, adjacent to water etc. If a horde unit is unable to deploy its settlement, then it cannot produce any food, apart from two for domestic production. The population will eat any stored food, and then any flock animals they have. When these are exhausted they will suffer attrition due to starvation. Flock animals will also suffer attrition due to lack of grazing. However, the horde can make use of any food resource in or adjacent to their hex unless another settlement is already using it."

HPTitle Settlement Surrender,Peaceful Surrender
HPHeading Settlement Surrender ,Peaceful Surrender
HPHeading Settlement Surrender Text 1,"Sometimes a settlement will surrender peacefully at the start of a battle, or when an enemy unit reaches a breach."
HPHeading Settlement Surrender Text 2,"This is most likely to occur when a barbarian faction employs terror tactics to intimidate the city. These include destroying nearby settlements, assaulting the settlement with driven civilians, or using terrifying incendiary weapons in the assault. A city may also surrender if totally surrounded and out of food. The number of skulls on top of the city tab give an indication of how likely the city is to surrender."
HPHeading Settlement Surrender Text 3,"If a character is in the city, the chances of it surrendering will be decreased according to his Ren value."

Many powerful kingdoms submitted to them, but now some of these are in revolt.

HPText Construction Intro 2,"The description shows both the cost to construct a building, and the cost to maintain it each turn."
HPHead Construction Queue,Construction Queue
HPText Construction Queue,"Buildings take several turns to construct, and only one can be worked on at a time. The lower part of the panel shows the queue of buildings under construction, with the number of turns required shown on the tile. You can drag the tiles around to reorder the queue, or drag tiles out of the panel to cancel construction."
HPText Construction Queue 2,The cost of construction is not deducted until a building reaches the head of the queue.
HPHead Temples and Schools,Temples and Schools
HPText Temples and Schools,"There are several types of these available, but only one type may be constructed in each settlement. If you want to construct a different type, you will need to destroy the first one."
HPHead Upgrade Settlement,Upgrading the Settlement
HPText Upgrade Settlement,"When a settlement is large enough, you may upgrade it by constructing the ""City"" building from the top row of the panel. This will allow it to contain more buildings and people. The number of buildings currently allowed in the settlement is shown by the buildings in the skyline below the construction queue. Defenses are not included in this limit."
HPHead Existing Buildings,Existing Buildings
HPText Existing Buildings,"Use the"" Constructed"" tab at the top of the panel to see what buildings have already been constructed. Tap or click a tile to see a description, and for an option to destroy it."
HPHead Number of Buildings,Number of Buildings Allowed
HPText Number of Buildings 1,"Each settlement has space for one palace, one temple or school, and a limited number of other buildings. The icons below the construction queue show how many buildings you have space for, and which spaces are occupied. Upgrading the settlement to a larger size increase the number of buildings that can be constructed."
HPText Number of Buildings 2,"Red and blue colored buildings are upgrades to existing buildings, and don't count towards the limit."
HPTitle Terrain Improvement,Land Improvement
HPHead LandImprovement Intro,Basics
HPText LandImprovement Intro,"When no other panel is open, you can improve the land around your settlements, construct buildings in the countryside, and build roads. Some actions require certain technology to carry them out. Use the buttons (which may be at the top or bottom of the screen depending on screen resolution) to switch between the various improvement modes."
HPText LandImprovement Intro 2,The tiles on the map show which hexes may be improved. Tap or click on the tile to schedule it to be improved. A number will appear showing the number of turns to completion. Tap or click it again to cancel the improvement.
HPText LandImprovement Intro 3,"Each category may be worked on independently, but each will require labor that will no longer be available for farming, slightly reducing food production and tax income."
HPHead Farm Improvements,Farms
HPText Farm Improvements,Turns a suitable hex into a farm or terrace that may be used for food production. Farms may also be improved to irrigated farms. Constructing a farm on the edge of your territory claims that hex for the settlement. Constructing farms has no monetary cost.
HPHead Clearance Improvements,Clearing
HPText Clearance Improvements,"Clear hexes to allow a farm or road to be built, or to be used for animal grazing. Clearing hexes has no monetary cost."
HPHead Road Improvements,Roads
HPText Road Improvements,"Roads allow faster movement of troops. Roads can be built out from city gates or from existing roads. Roads may be built in nearby hexes outside of a settlement's territory, but not in the territory of another settlement.  Building roads has no monetary cost."
HPHead External Buildings,External Buildings
HPText External Buildings,"Where suitable sites are available, some building types can be constructed outside of the settlement; for example ports, mines and mountain shrines. Since suitable sites are required, most settlements will only be able to construct one or two external buildings, and some may not be able to construct any at all."
HPText External Buildings 2,"Tap or click the building tile to open a panel showing its details, and the cost to construct it."
HPTitle Settlement Details,Settlement Details
HPHead Settlement Details Intro,Basics
HPText Settlement Details,"This panel gives a detailed explanation of the factors affecting your settlement. The four tabs give detailed breakdowns of the factors affecting income, unrest, food production, and labor allocation. Examining these details carefully will give clues about how to improve settlement performance, and are particularly important to pay attention to where unrest is high."
HPLink Food Production,Food Production
HPTitle Food Production,Food Production
HPHead Food Production,Food Production
HPText Food Production,"A settlement can produce food from four sources: animal or fish resources on the map. food produced inside the settlement from gardens or domestic animals, farming and animal grazing. Food can also be imported by trade."
HPText Agriculture,"One or two units of population are assigned to work each farm or terrace hex within the settlement's territory. The amount of food grown will depend on the hex type, the amount of population allocated, and modifiers due to technology. Population is automatically distributed to maximize output."
HPText Grazing,"Some societies are pastoral, depending on their animals for food, rather practicing agriculture. This requires more land than farming, but fewer people, and allows settlement on land too dry to grow crops. Each unit of population can look after animals grazing in two hexes, and each hex can support one or two flocks depending on its type. One unit of food is produced for each two grazed flocks."
HPText Grazing 2,"If your chosen faction is an agricultural one, you will not be able to use flocks. If your faction is a pastoral one, you won't be able to create farms until you develop agriculture."
HPTitle Unrest,Unrest
HPHeading Unrest Basics,Nobles and Peasants
HPText Unrest 1,"Unrest occurs when your people are unhappy. Different things make different people unhappy, so there are two types of unrest, ""peasant unrest"" and ""noble unrest"". As a ruler, you will have to balance the needs of the two groups."
HPText Unrest 2,"The final unrest for each group is composed of three elements, happiness, dissatisfaction, and suppression. The first two are opposed and can cancel each other out. Suppression is a measure of your ability to suppress dissent by use of force or intimidation, and is mostly based on the presence of military forces in the region. "
HPHeading Unrest Effects,Unrest Effects
HPText Unrest Effects 1,"Unrest below 60% has no effect, but remember that random events or fluctuations in local factors can cause it to increase unexpectedly. If unrest goes above this then several bad effects may occur. The income you can collect from the settlement may be reduced, you may not be able to recruit units from some recruitment pools, and the settlement or nearby armies are more likely to join a rebellion. Bandits appearing nearby are a sign of peasant unrest."
HPText Unrest Effects 2,If unrest gets above 90% there's an increasing risk of the settlement and nearby armies starting a new rebellion.
HPHeading Unrest Causes,Causes of Unrest
HPText Unrest Causes 1,"Both noble and peasant unrest can be caused by unpopular edicts, military service, natural disasters and random events. "
HPText Unrest Causes 2,"Local factors can be a major cause of dissatisfaction. They represent factors such as ancient grudges, particularly outspoken individuals or local traditions of independence, as well as minor local events such as fights, insults etc. There is nothing you can do about local factors, except to create happiness or suppression to counter them. They vary randomly over time, with a slight tendency to increase as the game progresses."
HPText Unrest Causes 3,"Peasant unrest will also increase if there is a shortage of food, overcrowding or they are continually asked to perform labor service constructing buildings or land improvements.  Dissatisfaction due to overcrowding can be reduced by expanding the settlement to a city or large city, and a few turns of not making any improvements will reduce dissatisfaction due to labor service."
HPText Unrest Causes 4,"Nobles are inherently independent, and dislike having anyone over them. They will try to assert their independence (which increases their unrest value) when they sense your realm is too large for you to control, i.e. your authority rating is insufficient for the number of settlements you control. Unrest will also be higher in settlements further from your capital."
HPHeader Dealing With Unrest,Dealing With Unrest
HPText Dealing With Unrest 1,"The best way to do deal with unrest, is either to address the root causes of dissatisfaction, or to counter it by constructing buildings or issuing edicts to create happiness. "
HPText Dealing With Unrest 2,"In the short term though, a character with a high Ren(virtue) rating can be sent to the settlement, or military forces placed in the garrison or nearby. Note though, that noble units will not suppress noble unrest, and militia or tribal units will not suppress peasant unrest."
HPLink Unrest,Unrest
HPTitle Rebellions,Rebellions
HPHeading Noble Rebelllions,Noble Rebellions
HPText Noble Rebellions,"Noble rebellions represent an attempt by one or more prominent noblemen to either overthrow the current faction leader, or to break away and form their own state. The nobles form their own breakaway faction that is automatically at war with you. "
HPHeading Peasant Rebellions,Peasant Rebellions
HPText Peasant Rebellions,"These are revolts by the peasant class against their common enemy, the aristocracy (which includes you). A peasant rebellion is not aimed at any one particular faction, rather they hate all equally. This makes them very dangerous, as once a rebellion begins, armies and settlements from any player may defect to it."
HPHeading Army Defections,Defecting Armies
HPText Army Defections 1,"Rebellions are particularly dangerous, because an army close to a rebel stack may defect to the rebels. An army consisting of mainly nobles may defect to a noble rebellion, and an army of mainly militia or tribesmen may defect to a peasant rebellion. The chances of defection depend on the composition of the stack, and the unrest level in the settlement (if in friendly territory). Imperial Guard and Regular Army units have no tendency to join with either sort of rebellion."
HPText Army Defections 2,"If a garrison stack defects, then so does the settlement it occupies."
HPLink Rebellions,Noble and Peasant Rebellions
HPTitle Trade,Trade
HPHeading Trade Basics,Introduction
HPText Trade Basics 1,"Certain buildings and resources on the map provide abstract trade items that can be traded to other settlements generating income. There are a number of different types, including copper, ceramics, silk and jade. They are not directly represented in the game, although sometimes there are benefits to having certain items available at a settlement. To begin trading with nearby settlements, construct a ""bazaar"" building. Upgrading this building will increase the value of trade generated, and the length of trade routes allowed. "
HPText Trade Basics 2,"The revenue generated trading with a particular settlement depends on the goods traded, and the population of the partner settlement. Since you cannot trade an item to a place that already produces it, try to establish production centers for each item, rather than trying to produce them everywhere."
HPHeading Trade Routes,Trade Routes
HPText Trade Routes 1,Trade routes are automatically established to nearby settlements when a bazaar is established. They are shown on the map (when zoomed out) as moving dotted lines in the color of the owning player. The rate of movement indicates the amount of trade flowing.
HPText Trade Routes 2,"Trade routes can't run through forests, so sometimes it will be necessary to clear the trees to establish a route. Trade routes are also blocked by the presence of enemy or hostile armies. Establish a Fraternal Harmony agreement with another player to stop them blocking your routes."
HPHeading Water Trade,Water Bourne Trade
HPText Water Trade,"Trade may also be conducted along navigable rivers, and across the sea, however it is only possible if both settlements have a ""Quay"" building. Moving goods by water is more efficient, so water borne trade is more valuable, and can be conducted over longer distances."
HPHeading Internal Trade,Internal Trade
HPText Internal Trade,"Some buildings that generate tradable items (e.g. ceramics or silk) also generate income from internal trade. Within a settlement. It's not necessary to establish a bazaar to receive this, but doing so will increase the value of the internal trade."
HPHeading Foreign Trade,Foreign Trade
HPText Foreign Trade,"So long as you are not at war, your settlements may also establish trade routes to settlements owned by other players. The value of some trade items is increased if you have a higher culture rating, and decreased if you have a lower one."
HPHeading Caravansaries,Caravansaries
HPText Caravansaries,"The length of direct trade routes is limited, but by establishing a Caravansary building, a settlement can re-export goods that is importing. A chain of one or more caravansaries can be used to move goods over long distance, for instance from a remote location to major cities."
HPLink Trade,Trade
HPTitle Execution Phase,Order Execution Phase
HPHead Execution Phase Intro,Basics
HPText Execution Phase Intro,"Once you have given your orders, and ended your turn, the orders of all players are executed simultaneously. Units march to their assigned positions, and enemy forces that meet fight battles."
HPText Execution Phase Intro 2D,"The rate at which time progresses depends on the camera height, so if you zoom in close men will move at a realistic rate, whereas if you zoom out they will move faster. Using the ""fast forward"" button forces everything to maximum speed. The space bar toggles between fast and normal modes."
HPText Execution Phase Intro 2T,"The rate at which time progresses depends on the camera height, so if you zoom in close men will move at a realistic rate, whereas if you zoom out they will move faster. Using the ""fast forward"" button, forces everything to maximum speed, but may result in jerky camera motion. "
HPText Execution Phase Intro 2P,"The pause button will pause unit movement and combat, but still allow you to move around the map and examine what is happening."
HPHead Execution Phase Battles,Battles
HPText Execution Phase Battles,"If two forces clash, a graphic for the battle will appear on the bar at the bottom, showing the sides and strengths. Click or tap the graphic to select the battle and zoom to its location. The battle plays out under computer control, with units acting according to the battle plan you set for them."
HPTitle Technology,Technology and Culture
HPHead Technology Intro,Basics
HPText Technology Intro,"The Technology and Culture screen lets you guide the social and technological development of your society. There are four different areas that develop simultaneously. Use the tabs at the top of the screen to show the developments available in each area, and to choose which to work on. You may choose one item from each area.  "
HPText Technology Power,"Power contains developments that are guided or enforced by the emperor, king or government. These include large scale construction and military reforms."
HPText Technology Craft,Craft contains developments relating to your society's ability to make things. Developments here represent the accumulation of know how and experience among your artisans.
HPText Technology Thought,"Thought is the area that deals with abstract ideas. It contains developments for philosophy, religion and the arts."
HPText Technology Knowledge,"Knowledge contains developments relating to the natural world, science, and discoveries of specific techniques."
HPHead Technology Developments,Developments
HPText Technology Developments,"Each potential development has a tile representing it, showing an icon for the development, the number of turns required to complete it, and a smaller icon for the type of development. Click or tap a tile to show details of the development and to allow it to be selected as the item in that area. The display at the bottom shows the current item selected in each area."
HPText Technology Developments 2,At the beginning only a few primitive developments may be selected. The connecting lines from the bottom of the tile show which items it will unlock. The differently colored tiles on the right of the panel are developments from other areas that must be completed before certain items in this area can be unlocked.
HPHead Technology Progress,Progress
HPText Technology Progress,"In general the rate of development is the same for all players, so small nations develop at the same rate as large ones. However, the rate of progress in certain areas or for specific types of development can be affected by the faction you control, edicts you issue, or buildings you construct. If there is modification to the progress rate of an entire area, it is shown at the top in the tab for that area. If there is modification to a specific item, it is indicated by a colored tab on the tile. Green indicates faster than usual progress, red slower. However, in all cases the number shown on the tile is the actual number of turns that will be required to complete the development."
HPLink Culture and Authority,About Culture and Authority
HPTitle Edicts,Edicts
HPHead Edicts Intro,The Basics
HPText Edicts Intro,"Edicts are laws and regulations that you issue to change the functioning of your state. They cover a wide range of measures from raising new taxes, to military reforms. They are also used to keep the balance between the central government, the nobility and the peasants."
HPText Edicts 1,"Each Edict has its own pros and cons. Some have long term benefits, while causing short term unrest, as changing laws always upsets someone. Others may have a cost per turn, or offer a short term gain in return for long term disadvantages. The panel on the left side shows the edicts that you can issue. Click on one to see details, and choose whether or not to issue it."
HPText Edicts 2,"The panel on the right shows edicts that have already been issued. Selecting one shows details, and may give an option to cancel it. Cancelling an edict too soon after issuing it will make you look weak and indecisive, reducing your authority."
HPText Edicts 3,"Some edicts cannot be cancelled, or are in effect for a specific period of time."
HPTitle Culture and Authority,Culture and Authority
HPHead Culture and Authority,Culture and Authority
HPText Culture and Authority,"These are two important values that reflect the development of your civilization, and how large it can grow. They are shown in the display in the bottom left of the map screen. They mainly increase from developments in Technology and Culture, as your people develop a shared culture, and become used to the idea of living in a large state or empire."
HPHead Authority,Authority
HPText Authority 1,"Authority is the quantity that governs the relations between you and the nobles of your realm. These have a natural desire to rebel and govern independently, which your authority discourages. In practical terms your Authority rating is the number of settlements you can keep under control. If you have more settlements than your Authority rating, the noble unrest in each one will be greatly increased, possibly leading to rebellion."
HPText Authority 2,"Authority comes from developments in Technology and Culture, from Edicts and from military success. It can be lost by cancelling Edicts, military defeats, and is temporarily reduced when a new leader takes the throne."
HPHead Culture,Culture
HPText Culture 1,"Your Culture rating represents your soft power, and the degree to which your people have a common identity and desire to be part of a common nation. It reduces unrest amongst both nobles and peasants alike. "
HPText Culture 2,"Culture mostly comes from development in Technology and Culture, although there are Edicts that increase it too. Unlike Authority, it generally only increases."

HPTitle Leaders,Characters
HPHead Leaders,Characters
HPText Leaders 1,"Characters represent the great people of history, and should be used to lead your most important armies, or govern your most difficult cities. One is your faction leader (king or emperor), another is his heir. As your kingdom develops you will acquire other characters representing the leading lights of your nation."
HPText Leaders 2,"Each character is attached to a military unit (his bodyguard) and can be moved around by moving this unit. If a stack has a character present, his portrait will be shown in the bottom left when it is selected."
HPText Leaders 3,Each character has two important attributes that reflect his capabilities. These may rise and fall as he ages or to reflect events in the game.
HPHead Leaders Qi,Qi
HPText Leaders Qi,Qi (energy) is shown by the stars below the portrait or next to the army banner. Qi increases the combat effectiveness of any stack the character commands.
HPHead Leaders De,Ren
HPText Leaders De,"Ren (virtue) is shown by the lightning symbols. A character's Ren increases the battle morale of the army he leads, and reduces unrest in any settlement where he is garrisoned. "
HPHead Succession,Succession
HPText Succession,"Your faction leader and heir are special in that they will never rebel against you. When the faction leader dies, the heir will become the new faction leader, and in due course a new heir will be appointed. If your faction leader dies without an heir (who has maybe died or not yet been appointed), then this will be a dangerous time for your kingdom and widespread rebellion may occur."
HPTitle Diplomacy,Diplomacy
HPHead Diplomacy Intro,Introduction
HPText Diplomacy Intro,The diplomacy systems allows you to interact with the other players you have met. You can make various sorts of treaties and deals with them. Open the Diplomacy display using the button on the right hand side.
HPHead Diplomacy Info,Display
HPText Diplomacy Display1,"The displays lists all the other players that you have encountered so far, and their allies (including vassals and overlords) and enemies. The colors on each bar show that player's relation to you. Selecting a bar will show some basic information about the state of your relations with them, and will usually allow you to open a direct negotiation. You can also initiate a negotiation by double clicking/tapping a player's bar."
HPText Diplomacy Display2,"The status column of the display also shows which other player (if any) a given player recognizes as their overlord or as the rightful emperor. An overlord is indicated by showing the overlord's symbol with a black decoration, and an emperor is shown with a gold decoration. Find the players who recognize you as emperor or overlord by scanning this column for you own symbol, or see the Relations tab of the Player Status screen."
HPLink Diplomacy,Diplomacy Display
HPTitle Vassals,"Vassals, Overlords and Emperors"
HPHead Vassals Intro,Introduction
HPText Vassals Intro 1,"During the game, players may sometimes submit to other players and become their vassals. The other player is then their overlord. Generally this will be to avoid destruction by the overlord, or to gain protection from a third party. The vassal continues to play the game, but is subject to certain restrictions. The overlord cannot attack his vassal, but gains a number of benefits. However, a vassal can rebel at any time."
HPHead Vassals Obligations,Obligations of Vassals
HPText Vassals Obligations 1,"When a player becomes a vassal, they lose a great deal of their diplomatic freedom. They may not attack any players that their overlord has a peace, non-aggression or defensive alliance with, nor any of their overlord's other vassals. They must always go to war with any player their overlord is at war with, and make peace with any that their overlord makes peace with."
HPText Vassals Obligations 2,"A vassal can only win the game by a cultural or points victory (although this is unlikely), and losses some authority. A vassal does not necessarily have to pay tribute, but a regular payment may well be part of the agreement."
HPText Vassals Obligations 3,"If a vassal's overlord is the vassal of another player, all the restrictions also apply to the overlord's overlord."
HPHead Overlords Obligations,Obligations and Privileges of Overlords
HPText Overlords Obligations 1,"A player's authority is increased for having vassals, but the main benefit of accepting a vassal, is that the vassal's population counts as your own for purposes of Domination and Son of Heaven victory conditions, but their settlements do not count towards your authority limit. Therefore accepting vassals allow you to increase your empire to a size much greater than could be supported with your authority rating. The risk is that your vassals could rebel if they think you look weak."
HPText Overlords Obligations 2,"An overlord may never attack their vassal, and is expected to defend them if they are attacked. "
HPHead About Emperors,Recognizing an Emperor
HPText About Emperors 1,"Accepting another player as an overlord is accepting a real position of subordination, while recognizing another player as Emperor is more of a nominal submission, and involves only minor sacrifices."
HPText About Emperors 2,"A player who recognizes another as Emperor suffers a small loss of authority, and may not be recognized as Emperor themselves. A player may only recognize one player as Emperor. A vassal automatically recognizes either their overlord, or  whomever their overlord recognizes as Emperor."
HPText About Emperors 3,"A player recognized as Emperor gains some authority, and may count the population of all those recognizing them towards a Son of Heaven victory."

You put together a proposal by selecting what you will offer, and what you want in return. When satisfied, hit the ""Submit Proposal"" button, to see whether they agree or not. "
HPText Negotiations Intro 2,"Whether they agree, will depend on a number of factors, how much they like you, how much they trust you, and your position in the game. You can increase the amount other players like you by making agreements that are favorable to them, or giving them gifts. Trust is earned by keeping your agreements, and lost by breaking them. Breaking an agreement reduces your trust from all the other players, not just the one who you broke the agreement with."
HPText Negotiations Intro 3,You will also receive offers from other players. You must chose whether to accept or reject them.
HPHead Negotiations Offers,Offers
HPText Negotiations Offers,"Use the panel on the left to select the items you will offer to the other party. They are organized by type, select a heading to show the items under it.

HPHead Negotiations Demands,Demands
HPText Negotiations Demands,"On the right side, are the items that you want to receive from the other player. If you select ""Become Vassal"" from the right side, you are demanding that they become your vassal. If you select ""Recognize Emperor"", you are demanding that they recognize you as Emperor."
HPHead Negotiations Declarations,Declarations
HPText Negotiations Declarations,"Declarations are a unilateral change in relations that you make. In this case the offer merely serves to inform the other player. You may not include declarations with other items. You can declare war with a declaration, which is also the way for a vassal to revolt against their overlord."

The agreement remains in force until one side breaks it by declaring war, or the agreed time limit is reached."
HPHead Defensive Alliances,Defensive Alliance
HPText Defensive Alliances,"In a defensive alliance, each side agrees to declare war against any power that attacks the other. However, if the other player declares war on another power, there is no obligation to assist. In addition all the terms of a Fraternal Harmony Pact are in force. The treaty lasts until one side breaks it by not declaring war when required to do so."
HPHead Peace Treaties,Peace Treaty
HPText Peace Treaties,"When a Peace Treaties is made, the two sides agree not to make war on each other for the given time, nor to block each other's trade routes, or to block each other's farming. In essence, it is the same as a Fraternal Harmony agreement, but with a shorter time span. When a Peace Treaty expires, the two parties do not return to a state of war, but either party is free to attack the other again, without it being regarded as a breach of trust."

HPText Battle Plans Intro 1,"During your turn you may assign a battle plans to units, that determines how it will behave in battle. By default it is set to attack, which is fine for most situations, but for important battles you may want to fine tune your tactics. If you set a defensive plan (ambush, defend, reserve or withdraw) for all units in a stack, it will stop when encountering enemy, rather than initiating a battle."
HPText Battle Plans Intro 2,"To set a battle plan, use the button below the unit stack, then select the plan from the pop up. If you have any units selected in the stack, the plan will be set for just those units, otherwise for the whole stack."
HPText Battle Plans Intro 3,"The plans are listed below in order of aggressiveness. In siege assaults, units with the most aggressive plans will be selected preferentially for assaulting breaches."
HPHead Battle Plans Charge,Charge
HPText Battle Plans Charge,"Make an immediate all out melee attack. This plan is useful to force units with missile weapons to attack in hand to hand combat, or if you want to attack quickly before the enemy can withdraw, or receive reinforcements. It's a plan that should be used with care."

HPHead Battle Plans Ambush,Ambush
HPText Battle Plans Ambush,"Wait in position concealed from the enemy, until there is an opportunity to attack them in flank or rear, or otherwise make a highly favorable attack. This plan is only effective if in forest terrain that can provide concealment. Otherwise it is the same as defend."
HPHead Battle Plans Defend,Defend
HPText Battle Plans Defend,"Hold a defensive position, only attack enemy that come close to the position. This is useful to keep a defensive line, or to avoid units moving into unfavorable terrain."
HPHead Battle Plans Reserve,Reserve
HPText Battle Plans Reserve,"Hold position. Only move to engage enemy that are engaging or threatening other friendly units. Can be useful to combat outflanking enemy, to maintain a second line of missile units behind a defensive line, or to keep a leader's bodyguard from fighting unless absolutely necessary."
HPHead Battle Plans Withdraw,Withdraw
HPText Battle Plans Withdraw,"Avoid combat. If the battle is going badly, withdraw. It isn't possible for a whole stack to withdraw without engaging, so you'll need to pick one or more units to act as a rearguard by given them a different battle plan (e.g. defend)."

HPHeading Battle Intro,When Battles Occur
HPText Battles Intro 1,"Battles occur when an army moves into a hex adjacent to an enemy army (unless it is already moving away), or when two armies simultaneously move into adjacent hexes. When a battle begins, the armies arrange themselves according to their battle plans, and fight the battle until one side is destroyed, or their morale breaks and they run away."
HPText Battles Intro 2,"Unit stacks that are adjacent to a battle will generally be included in it, unless moving away, and stacks that arrive while the battle is in progress can join the battle as reinforcements."
HPText Battles Intro 3,"Battles proceed entirely under computer control. Players may not control units directly, although they may of course indirectly affect the course of the battle by the battle plans and formations they have previously set."
HPText Battles Intro 4,"Battles that are currently taking place will be shown along the bottom of the screen. Clicking one will move the camera to its location, and bring up a display showing the number of men left on each side."
HPHeading Battle Resolution,Battle Resolution
HPText Battle Resolution 1,"Battles are resolved on a soldier by soldier basis. When a soldier fires a missile, or takes a swing at an enemy, the chance of scoring a kill is computed using a large number of factors. These include the weapons used, the troop types, the combat skill, experience and readiness of each combatants, the terrain, and of course the defender's armor. The Qi rating of a stack's general also boosts the attack of his men, and many technology advancements will improve effectiveness in combat. In melee, attacking from the rear is of course much more effective."
HPText Battle Resolution 2,"As units fight and take casualties, their morale will gradually reduce, and if it falls low enough, they will break and run away. Initial morale depends mainly on the troop type of a unit and the Ren rating of their commanding general. Morale is mainly reduced by casualties suffered, but may also be affected by being attacked by certain troop types or weapons."
HPLink Battle Basics,Battle Basics
HPTitle Post Battle,After the Battle
HPHeading Post Battle,After the Battle
HPText Post Battle 1,"Generally battles continue, until all of one side's units have been destroyed or have run away. The loser's units will retreat to a nearby hex, while the winner's will regroup and may continue moving, possibly engaging in further battles."
HPText Post Battle 2,The winner of a battle may recover some of the their casualties (these soldiers were wounded not killed). How many wounded soldiers can be recovered depends on what medical advancements the player has. All the losers casualties are lost permanently.
HPText Post Battle 3,A battle that has been going on too long will automatically be ended as a draw as both sides mutually disengage. This happens when each side is unable or unwilling to attack the other effectively.
HPHeading Experience,Experience Gain
HPText Experience,"Units that have been involved in battle, will gain in experience, depending on their involvement. With enough experience they will gain chevrons on their unit card, which increase their effectiveness. Both winners and losers can gain experience."
HPHeading Battle Reports,Battle Reports
HPText Battle Reports,"After a battle, a report will be added to your message list, giving a detailed breakdown of how each unit fared. Units that gained an experience chevron are shown with a yellow splash. A red splash highlights a destroyed unit. Note that casualties recovered after a battle are not shown in the report."

HPTitle Battle Unit Types,Unit Roles In Battle
HPHeading Battle Unit Infantry,Infantry
HPText Battle Unit Infantry,"Your foot soldiers are the mainstay of most armies. They are particularly useful for siege battles, and suffer little or no penalty for operating in difficult terrain, unless they are armed with long weapons. Infantry can be vulnerable to cavalry or chariots, unless armed with halberds or long spears, and are also vulnerable to artillery if they are in close order. "
HPHeading Battle Unit Chariots,Chariots
HPText Battle Unit Chariots 1,"The chariot was a significant advance in military technology. Chariot mounted warriors can move faster, wear heavier armor and carry more ammunition than soldiers on foot. The height of their fighting platform gives them another edge over infantry, and taken together all their advantages outweigh their small numbers. "
HPText Battle Unit Chariots 2,"Chariots move faster than infantry in open terrain, but slower in difficult terrain and cannot enter forests. If forced to fight in forests, marshes or on steep slopes, they are very vulnerable and suffer large combat penalties."
HPHeading Battle Unit Cavalry,Cavalry
HPText Battle Unit Cavalry,"Cavalry are a cheaper and more efficient way of using horses in battle than chariots. They move faster, suffer lower terrain penalties, and have a combat bonus when fighting chariots. They also receive a combat bonus against infantry and a special charge attack when they contact. The latter is particularly effective when the cavalry are armed with long spears. "
HPHeading Battle Unit Artillery,Artillery
HPText Battle Unit Artillery 1,"The main use for artillery is to knock down walls and destroy towers in siege battles. Smaller types of engine may not be able to damage the largest walls, but can always attack towers."
HPText Battle Unit Artillery 2,"Artillery can also be useful in field battles. However, since they cannot move, they will need to be positioned carefully to be useful. Stone throwers can do a lot of damage, but are inaccurate and can sometimes hit your own troops. Bolt shooters are useful for long range sniping at enemy engines, or attacking cavalry or heavily armored enemy."
HPText Battle Unit Artillery 3,"When an artillery unit is ordered to move, it is packed up onto carts, and cannot fight in battle. Artillery is thus much easier to use when not moving. If you want to move and fight, make sure not to include the artillery in the move order if you want them to fight in the battle."
HPLink Units In Battle,Unit Types In Battle
HPTitle Siege Assaults,Siege Assault Battles
HPHeading Siege Assault Intro,Introduction
HPText Siege Assault Intro 1,"If you attack a settlement, then a siege assault battle will occur. The attacker's siege engines and archers will attack the settlement walls and towers, trying to create a breach in the wall, or force a gate open. They will then attack the breaches or gates and attempt to force their way in. Defending units are allocated to protect a breach when an enemy unit comes near. Units defending a gate or breach never run away."
HPText Siege Assault Intro 2,"The settlement surrenders, and the battle ends when an attacking unit reaches a breach or open gate, and their is no defending unit available to defend it. When the city surrenders, all defending units that started in the settlement are destroyed."
HPHeading Settlement Defenses,Settlement Defenses
HPText Settlement Defenses,"If a settlement has a wall, it will also have some towers that can fire on the attackers. If missile units are garrisoned in the settlement, they are assumed to be garrisoning the towers, boosting their attack rate, and changing the projectiles used from simple arrows, to whatever they are armed with. A strong garrison will combine some missile units to fire on attackers, with some strong defensive melee troops to defend breaches."
HPHeading Prolonged Sieges,Prolonged Sieges
HPText Prolonged Sieges 1,"The attacker must capture the settlement within the time limit allowed for battles, which is usually not possible if the settlement is well defended. If the settlement is not captured, the siege continues, and the attacker can try again in the next turn."
HPText Prolonged Sieges 2,"Any damage caused to the defenses is remembered from turn to turn. Two damaged pieces (wall, gate or tower) are automatically repaired each turn, even when under attack."
HPHeading Unwalled Settlements,Unwalled Settlements
HPText Unwalled Settlements,"If a settlement has no walls, then the attackers must force their way in along one of the four entry roads. Defending units will defend these as if defending a wall breach, but without protective walls, they will be very vulnerable to missile fire."

Militia Light Spearmen old,Militia Light Spearmen

Militia Dagger Axemen old,Militia Dagger Axemen
Militia Dagger Axemen Desc,"Equipped with a long handled dagger axe, these men can deliver lethal chopping blows, and hook aside shields. As ill trained farmers, they may not have the stomach for a prolonged fight, but used wisely can be deadly. Historically they were the mainstay of early Chinese infantry forces."
Militia Long Spearmen old,Militia Long Spearmen
Militia Long Spearmen Desc,"With their long two handed spears, and close formation this unit has a strong defense against both foot and mounted attack. However, lacking shields does leave them a little vulnerable to missile fire."
Noble Archers,Noble Archers
Noble Archers Desc,"These soldiers are drawn from the higher classes of society, well equipped and trained for battle. They can deal lethal damage from distance, but are not well equipped for close combat."

Army Medium Chariot,Trained Chariots
Army Medium Chariot Desc,"Only a powerful lord can afford to field a significant force of chariots. The swift chariot carrying an archer, a close combat soldier, and driver provides mobility and firepower that can offer a decisive edge over a purely infantry force."
Army Heavy Chariot,Trained Chariots
Army Heavy Chariot Desc,"Only a powerful lord can afford to field a significant force of chariots. The stout four horse chariot carrying an archer, a close combat soldier, and driver provides mobility and shock power that can offer a decisive edge over a purely infantry force."
Army Dagger Axemen,Trained Dagger Axemen
Army Dagger Axemen Desc,"A force of trained men will be much superior to part time militias in combat. Their sharp bronze dagger axes can inflict lethal blows any enemies, even those in heavy armor."
Army Light Archers,Trained Archers
Army Light Archers Desc,"A force of low born men kept permanently under arms, will acquire skill with weapons far beyond barely trained militias. Although they may not quite equal those born to a life of war, they can still put down an impressive rain of arrows. "
Settlers,Settlers
Settlers Desc,"Maybe this is a group of adventurous souls setting off to create a new life for themselves in an unclaimed area of the world, maybe they are refugees from an advancing enemy, maybe they are being forced to relocate by the whims of an unscrupulous overlord. Whatever their reasons, you can use them to found a new settlement in a suitable location. Be sure to protect them carefully, as they have little defense against enemy soldiers."
Bodyguard,Bodyguard
Bodyguard Desc,"This unit represents a great leader and the small group of hand picked men who protect him in battle. With the finest equipment, high morale and excellent training, this unit can exercise an influence in battle out of all proportion to its numbers. In do or die battles the leader should lead his bodyguard in the vanguard of the attack, to inspire his men, and break the enemy lines."
Chariot Bodyguard,Bodyguard

Mounted in swift chariots, the unit can swiftly moved to whichever corner of the realm is threatened."
Convict Axemen,Do Or Die Convicts
Convict Axemen Desc,"These desperate men have been promised their freedom if they perform well in battle. Lacking armor or much training, they are sure to suffer heavy casualties, but their desperation keeps them fighting, and makes them feared by all opposing forces. "
WS Cavalry,Cavalry
WS Cavalry Desc,"With sturdy horses, and the skill to ride them, the men in this unit combine speed, flexibility and power. They can move swiftly, combat enemy cavalry and chariots, outflank infantry, and run down lighter foot soldiers."
Army Crossbows,Trained Crossbows
Army Crossbows Desc,"The heavy hitting crossbow is particularly effective against armored troops and cavalry, an advantage that offsets its lower rate of fire compared to regular bows. With their low rate of fire and flat firing arc,  they're best placed in front of the army. They're also effective for siege defenders where reloaders can assist those firing from the arrow slits."
Militia Repeating Crossbow old,Militia Chu-ko-nu
Militia Repeating Crossbow Desc,"Easy to make and easy to learn, the chu-ko-nu, or repeating crossbow, allows poorly trained militias to put down a heavy barrage of fire. The accuracy and effectiveness of each shot is poor, especially against armored troops, but the sheer volume of fire can be unnerving."
Militia Halberds old,Militia Halberds
Militia Halberds Desc,"Equipped with their useful multi-purpose halberds, these militia have a multitude of uses. The perpendicular spike on their halberds can be used with chopping strokes to punch through armor, or as a hook to pull aside shields, or unseat horse riders. The other spike, allows the halberd to be used as a spear to fend of cavalry and chariot attacks."
Army Heavy Spearmen,Heavy Spearmen
Army Heavy Spearmen Desc,"With stout shields and long spears, the Heavy Spearmen can form a strong core to an army. They can hold  off mounted and foot soldiers alike, creating a base for other arms to launch their assaults from."
Army Spear/Crossbows,Spear / Crossbows

Noble Cavalry,Noble Cavalry
Noble Cavalry Desc,"Well armored and equipped with a halberd, these gentlemen can hold their own in any cavalry fight."
WS Army Halberds,Army Halberds
WS Army Halberds Desc,"Well trained men using the fearsome halberd. The halberd's length and sharp point provide good protection against cavalry and chariots, and its sharp point is effective against armor. However, the lack of a shield may leave the halberdiers vulnerable to missile fire if they can't be equipped with armor."
WS Light Horse Archers,Light Horse Archers
WS Light Horse Archers Desc,"These swift light horsemen depend on their speed to keep them from harm, while they pepper enemies with their arrow fire. Not only are they hard to pin down and destroy in battle, they also move quickly on the march, making them ideal troops for raiding, and strategic outflanking."
WS Heavy Horse Archers,Heavy Horse Archers
WS Heavy Horse Archers Desc,"Close formed cavalry, primarily armed with bows, this unit combines firepower with the strategic and tactical mobility of cavalry. They rely on armor rather than mobility for protection. They are a particularly good counter to lighter horse archers, as no horse can outrun an arrow."
WS Cavalry Crossbows,Cavalry Crossbows
WS Cavalry Crossbows Desc,"Close formed cavalry armed with cross bows, this unit delivers effective firepower against both armored foot and cavalry. However, its rate of fire is less than cavalry using conventional bows."
Picked Swordsmen,Picked Swordsmen

They're most effective fighting against lightly armored troops, or in woods, marshes and on steep hills."
Guard Halberds,Guard Halberds
Guard Halberds Desc,"These are an elite unit of heavy infantry, highly trained, and equipped with the best weapons and armor.

This unit fears no opponents, and whether attacking or defending, is the core of any army."
WS Guard Cavalry,Guard Cavalry
WS Guard Cavalry Desc,"These elite troopers combine mobility and shock power. They can defeat any cavalry, and all but the toughest infantry. They can spearhead an attack, or be used as a formidable reserve."
IC Militia Halberds old,Militia Halberds
IC Militia Halberds Desc,"While their training and motivation may not be the highest, militia troops armed with a halberd can take their place in the line. Their halberds can inflict damage on even well armored troops, and are dangerous for cavalry to attack. Their weakness is their vulnerability to missile fire."
Army Three Eyed Guns,Trained Three Eyed Gunners
Army Three Eyed Guns Desc,"The three eyed gun comprises three short barrels on a long haft. While these guns may be primitive, their bullets are still deadly to any, no matter their armor, and with three barrels they can launch a deadly firestorm before having to reload. They are especially useful in siege defenses, where several men can reload for the one gunner at an arrow slit."
Army Beehive Rocketeers,Beehive Rocketeers
Army Beehive Rocketeers Desc,"Armed with a thick paper tube containing a bundle of small rockets, these men can unleash a barrage of fire akin to a swarm of angry bees. Their rockets may not have great accuracy, but they can travel long distances causing fear and confusion throughout an enemy force. Make sure to place them in the front line, or they will cause fear and confusion to your own army too."
Army Zhan Ma Dao,Trained Zhan Ma Daos
Army Zhan Ma Dao Desc,"Zhan Ma Dao, literally means horse chopping sword. It is a long heavy sword blade mounted on a long haft, especially designed for chopping at horses legs. This unit can inflict massive damage on enemy cavalry, and is also effective against heavy infantry. However, the weapon's size and weight make it a little clumsy against lighter troops, and needing two hands, it cannot be used with a shield."
Picked Zhan Ma Dao,Picked Zhan Ma Dao
Picked Zhan Ma Dao Desc,"Zhan Ma Dao, literally means horse chopping sword. It is a long heavy sword blade mounted on a long haft, especially designed for chopping at horses legs. This unit is composed of picked men, tasked with hunting down and killing enemy cavalry. Such a powerful weapon can also be against heavy infantry, though its size and weight make it a little clumsy against lighter troops, and needing two hands, it cannot be used with a shield."
IC Cataphract Cavalry,Cataphract Cavalry
IC Cataphract Cavalry Desc,"With both man and horse covered in metal armor, these men fear only the heaviest weapons. Armed with a long spear, they are deadly in the charge against infantry and cavalry alike."
IC Cataphract Archers,Cataphract Archers
IC Cataphract Archers Desc,"Armed with both bow and long spear, this unit is the ultimate all round cavalry unit. It can engage at range with archery, or deliver deadly charges. Both man and horse are covered in heavy armor, protecting them from all but the heaviest weapons."
Guard Spearmen,Guard Spearmen
Guard Spearmen Desc,"These elite troops, with heavy armor, large shields and long spears, can form an almost unbreakable defensive wall. Use them to anchor your defense while wearing down the enemy with missiles, or working around their flanks."
Guard Archers,Guard Archers
Guard Archers Desc,"Four ranks of archers behind a rank of spearmen with long shields, this elite unit can put down a heavy and sustained barrage of arrow fire, while being well enough protected to stand in the battle line. Although melee is not their specialty, the spearmen in the front rank can fend off most enemies."

IC Guard Cataphract Cavalry Desc,"This is an elite unit of lancers, with both horses and men covered in the finest armor. Their charge is deadly to all."
IC Imperial Guard Cavalry,Imperial Guard Cavalry
IC Imperial Guard Cavalry Desc,"This unit embodies the ultimate evolution of the cavalryman. With both man and horse covered in the heaviest armor, and armed with both long spears and bows, this unit can be deadly in the charge against heavily armored foes, while being able to effective engage swifter cavalry with bow fire. The men are equally well trained in the use of both weapons."
Convict Swordsmen,Do or Die Convict Swordsmen
Convict Swordsmen Desc,"These condemned men are fighting to earn redemption. Their weapons may be light, and their armor lacking, but these desperadoes' motivation makes them dangerous to any but the most powerful enemies. These men are on a do or die mission, but since they lack protection against both missiles and cavalry, it is best to launch them at the enemy as quickly as possible."
IC Noble Halberds,Noble Halberds
IC Noble Halberds Desc,"These men belong to the old school, preferring to do their fighting on foot. There fearsome halberds can punch through armor, or topple a horse rider, while being long enough to fend off cavalry and chariots."
Small Trebuchet,Whirlwind
Small Trebuchet Desc,"This small engine uses human muscle to fling stones over long distances. Its main purpose is as an anti personnel weapon, as the stones it throws are too light to do much damage to fortifications."
Medium Trebuchet,Crouching Tiger
Medium Trebuchet Desc,"Named from its shape, this general purpose engine can be used to demolish palisades and wooden superstructures, or to fling incendiaries against buildings or troops."
Large Trebuchet,Four Legged Trebuchet
Large Trebuchet Desc,"With its large crew and solid build, this engine can fling stones large enough to create breaches in even stone walls, and quickly demolish buildings and lighter fortifications."
Counterweight Trebuchet,Muslim Trebuchet
Counterweight Trebuchet Desc,"Believed to have originated in the Middle East, this engine represents the epitome of mechanical siege craft. Unlike earlier engines, it uses a falling weight, rather than human strength, to hurl its projectiles. This produces much greater accuracy, allowing it to strike the same place over and over again, and destroy the target much more quickly than less accurate engines."
Large Crossbow Ballista,Giant Triple Crossbow
Large Crossbow Ballista Desc,"With three giant composite bows for power, this machine can hurl a three meter long projectile over hundreds of meters with high accuracy. It outranges all other mechanical engines, and all forms of bow, and its bolts are large enough to damage light fortifications, or carry incendiary material to start fires."
Small Crossbow Ballista,Giant Double Crossbow

Packed Artillery,Packed Artillery
Packed Artillery Desc,An artillery unit packed onto carts for transport.
Hundred Tigers Launcher,100 Tigers Rocket Launcher
Hundred Tigers Launcher Desc,"Consisting of a rack of many small rockets mounted on wheelbarrow, the Hundred Tigers launcher can unleash a fearsome barrage against an advancing enemy. The noise and spectacle of the barrage, combined with the unpredictable flight path of the rockets, can spread dismay widely throughout the force. They are best deployed in the front line in defensive positions, lest they cause as much damage to friend as foe."
Small Cannon,Small Cannon
Small Cannon Desc,"The cannon's main use is in battering down walls, as repeated strikes from small hard cannon balls can shatter any masonry. A cannon ball can also scythe through multiple ranks of soldiers, but the shot's flat trajectory means the cannons must be placed in front of your own troops."
Tribal Light Archers,Tribal Light Archers
Tribal Light Archers Desc,"These men have learned to use the bow since childhood, practicing the art of archery to catch game, and protect their herds from predators, both animal and human. Although lacking the best equipment, their aim is excellent, as is their fighting ardor, though the latter can fade if things turn difficult. "
Tribal Light Spearmen,Tribal Light Spearmen
Tribal Light Spearmen Desc,"These are the poorest of the tribe, lacking skills in archery and horsemanship, they are equipped with simple spears and shields.

Tribal Horse Archers,Tribal Horse Archers
Tribal Horse Archers Desc,"These men are born to a life in the saddle, practically living on the backs of their horses.

ENB Noble Horse Archers,Noble Horse Archers
ENB Noble Horse Archers Desc,"These men are the leaders of the tribe. Well equipped, and trained for war since birth, they are formidable and determined warriors. Although by no means unwilling to engage in close combat, they consider it no disgrace to destroy their enemies at a distance using their superior archery skills."
Nomad Settlers,Nomad Settlers
Nomad Settlers Desc,"Perhaps they seek greener pastures, or maybe just a change of scenery or company, but this band of nomads has broken off from the main party, to seek a place to make their own encampment. Sustained by their animals, they can wander far and wide until they find a spot that suits them."
Militia Heavy Spearmen old,Militia Heavy Spearmen

NB Noble Armored Archers,Noble Armored Archers
NB Noble Armored Archers Desc,"With both man and horse heavily protected this unit will prevail in almost any missile exchange. Although preferring to wear down their enemies with missile fire, they are by no means afraid to fight hand to hand. Their armored horses being particularly useful if it becomes necessary to charge stubborn infantry."
NB Noble Heavy Cavalry,Noble Heavy Cavalry
NB Noble Heavy Cavalry Desc,"This unit represents the ultimate evolution of the steppe warrior.

Mercenary Horse Archers Desc,"Some of these men are refugees from various misfortunes, others enjoy the life as a soldier.

Mercenary Heavy Horse Desc,"These are men from the Northern Steppe who by choice or circumstance, now make their living as professional soldiers. They are  well armored and equipped, with superb archery skills, and great horsemanship.

Southern Tribesmen,Southern Tribesmen
Southern Tribesmen Desc,"These are men from the jungles of the South. They come from primitive tribes, and are lightly equipped with spears and simple shields. They should not be relied on in the main battle line, but are useful in forests and other difficult terrain."
Southern Tribal Archers,Southern Tribal Archers
Southern Tribal Archers Desc,"These men are from the primitive tribes of the southern jungles. They're only equipped with simple bows. While their individual archery skills ar good, their poor equipment mean they are only moderately effective in battle. However, they can cause damage to lightly armed troops, and are cheap to hire."
Barbarian Mercenaries,Barbarian Mercenaries
Barbarian Mercenaries Desc,"These are men from the warrior caste of the barbarian tribes of central China. For various reasons, they have left their homeland to make a living from war. They fight on foot while wearing heavy bronze or rhinoceros hide armor, and wield lethal dagger axes.

LDR Faction Leader Text,"This character is the leader of your faction, your King, Emperor or Khan. You may use him in the same way as other characters to lead armies, or govern settlements, but there are a couple of extra things to consider
Firstly, he has a personal Authority rating, which is added to the Authority rating of your empire. This can be increased by winning major battles, but also decreased by significant defeats. This Authority is lost when the leader dies.
Secondly, when your faction leader dies, a new one will be appointed. However, to represent the uncertainty of succession, his Authority will be temporarily reduced. This will be a time of danger for your empire when revolts are more likely to occur."
LDR Faction Heir Text,"This character is your faction's heir. When your faction leader dies, he will become the new leader. When he succeeds, his Authority will be temporarily reduced, but not by too much. The heir's personal Authority rating has no direct effect, until he becomes faction leader.
If the heir dies, a new one will be appointed after a period of time. If the faction leader dies while there is no heir, the new leader's Authority will be reduced much more severely."
LDR Top General Text,"This character is multi-talented, and will excel at either leading armies, or governing settlements."

LDR Best As General Text,"This man is mainly noted for his energy and martial prowess. He is best used to lead an army, which will fight better under his leadership. He may be placed as governor of a city, but will contribute little in that role."
LDR Poor Leader Text,"This man has little to commend him, being listless and lacking moral strength. Maybe a spell on the frontlines will improve his character."
LDR Generic Leader Text,"You can use this character to either lead an army, or to govern a city (by placing him in the garrison stack). His qi rating will improve the fighting ability of any troops he commands, and his ren rating will reduce unrest in the city he governs."
LDR Other Player Character,"Know your enemy, as you know yourself."

UI Authority Description,"Authority represents the respect that local leaders have for the central state. It encompases both the fear of retribution for disobedience, and the belief that a central state is necessary and desirable. Your authority determines the number of settlements you can directly control. If you have more settlements than your authority rating then all your settlements will suffer increased noble unrest. Authority will be temporarily reduced when a new faction leader takes over, making this a period of danger. Authority doesn't affect peasant unrest."
UI Culture Description,"Culture represents that state of advance of your state, and the degree to which your people voluntarily associate with it. Culture reduces unrest among both peasants and nobles, but affects the nobles more. Culture comes from advances in the Technology and Culture tree, but can also be boosted by certain edicts."

UI Conquest Victory Text,"Raw military might is an argument that can only be answered in kind. When none remain who can oppose your argument, then none can doubt your supremacy. You can win a Conquest Victory by controlling {0:d0}% of the total game population. Population controlled by your vassals counts as under your control."
UI Culture Victory Text,"While conquerors can shape the world for a time, ideas and culture have a more lasting influence. If you can establish your faction as the cultural driving force of the area, then history will consider it the most important of its time. To win a Cultural Victory, you must amass {0:d0} culture victory points and have {1:d}% more points than the second highest player. Your culture victory points are the sum of your culture rating, and all culture victory points from buildings that you have constructed or captured. Palaces, temples, shrines and other buildings provide culture victory points."
UI Glory Victory Text,"Sometimes many factions can co-exist without any one clearly dominating. Deciding which was most important or successful means weighing their size, influence, and cultural achievements. If the game ends without any player winning by another victory condition, then the victor is the player with the highest victory score. This is calculated based on both the cultural victory points, the amount of population controlled directly, or by vassals, and by the population who recognize the faction's leader as emperor."
UI SOH Victory Text,"When you are widely recognized as the Son of Heaven and rightful Emperor, then none can doubt your legitimacy of your rule. You win a Son of Heaven Victory when {0:d0}% of the game's population recognize you as Emperor. Your own population, that of your vassals, and that of the players who recognize you as Emperor count towards this total."

BD Armorer Desc,This small group of skilled artisans can make enough leather or other light armor to outfit most trained soldiers recruited in this settlement. They can also produce the small quantities of higher quality armor for noblemen and elite soldiers.
BD Armor Works Desc,"With a small group of skilled artisans directing a less skilled workforce, the armor works can turn out sufficient quantities of leather or light armor to equip all militia troops, and enough light metallic armor for all trained soldiers."
BD Armor Factory Desc,"Armor production on an industrial scale can supply enough quality metal armor for all trained soldiers. It can also produce large quantities of lighter armor, so that even militia troops can have metal armor."
BD Foundry Desc,"The foundry is the place where raw ores are turned into useful bronze. Bronze can be used for many tools and ceremonial objects, and can be traded to neighboring settlements. A steady supply of quality metal is also needed for production of advanced weapons and armor."
BD Iron Foundry Desc,"The Iron Foundry includes the hot furnaces required for the large scale production of iron. Once the technology is in place, iron is far cheaper than bronze, providing more value to the local economy, and ultimately fetching more in trade due to the wider range of uses for it. A steady supply of steel is also needed for certain advanced weapons and armors. "
Zhou Desc,"The Zhou are a tough Chinese people in the Wei River valley to the west. Their rulers have a reputation as wise sage kings, and are renowned for their skill at chariot warfare. Historically, they overthrew the decadent Shang and formed the third, and longest lived, great dynasty. They were the first to claim the mandate of Heaven, a claim to legitimacy used by all subsequent dynasties."
Wu Desc,"Wu occupies the area around the mouth of the Yangtze River. It's rulers are Chinese, but the people engage in practices considered somewhat barbarous, such as tattooing and cutting hair. They are skilled with boats and ships, and are particularly skilled at making swords. Although their land is bountiful, it is unsuitable for horse rearing.
Historically the original kingdom of Wu was destroyed by Min, but the name was used by several later states, most notably during the famous Three Kingdoms period."

This makes more efficient use of human energy, and allows tired men to be more easily replaced by fresh ones. Although they can be used in coastal waters, the paddle wheels do not work as well on the rougher sea."

HPHead Trade Settlement,Settlements
HPText Trade Settlement1,"You can sometimes transfer control of a settlement to another player, or have them transfer one to you. This will happen immediately. In reality though, control of large cities could not just be changed on the ruler's whim, so the situations in which you can offer or receive settlements is limited."
HPText Trade Settlement2,"A settlement may change hands as part of a peace negotiation, or if it is small enough to be relocated. Otherwise a settlement may be returned to its original founder, or the previous owner, or a noble rebel faction against one of these. A faction may not give up control of its capital."
HPHead Enemy Information,Enemy Information

You may similarly offer to share the location of your enemies cities with another player."
HPHead Trade Embargo,Trade Embargo
HPText Trade Embargo,"If you declare a trade embargo against another player, then trade is cut off both ways, you can neither export to, nor import from them. This may hurt you more than it hurts them, so check your trade routes before issuing an embargo. This is a declaration, and they do not have to agree to it, but are unlikely to be happy about it."

TT BP Harass New,"Harass
Move immediately to harass the enemy, without forming into battle line. Prefer to attack with projectiles, and only engage in melee on very favorable terms. Cavalry, chariots and foot units entirely armed with missiles may skirmish away from attacking enemy."

TT BP Ambush New,"Ambush
Wait concealed in ambush until an opportunity exists to attack into the enemy's flank or rear. Only effective in forest terrain, otherwise counts as a ""Support"" or ""Harass"" battle plan.

HPText Battle Plans Charge New,"Immediately move to attack the enemy by melee attack, without forming into battle line. This plan is useful to force units with missile weapons to attack in hand to hand combat;  to attack quickly before the enemy can withdraw, or receive reinforcements; or to disrupt the formation of the enemy's battle line. Units with the charge plan suffer a small defense penalty against both missile and melee attacks."
HPText Battle Plans Attack New,"Form up into a battle line then, advance to attack the enemy using either missiles or hand to hand combat. If other units are performing harass or outflank plans, then delay the attack to allow those plans to take effect. The attack may also be delayed if at least half the front rank units of the battle line have missiles, or the battle line has more missiles than the opposing enemy."
HPText Battle Plans Harass New 1,"Advance on the enemy without forming into battle line.  Prefer shooting and only attack in melee combat in advantageous circumstances.  Missile armed cavalry and chariot units, and foot units entirely armed with missiles will skirmish away from threatening enemy. "
HPText Battle Plans Harass New 2,"This plan is useful for missile armed cavalry to wear down the enemy with missile fire;   to send infantry missile units forward to shoot up the enemy while forming up, or to counter enemy doing the same. Another use is to prevent units in small adjacent stacks, from being integrated into the battle line, and disrupted the unit arrangement."
HPText Battle Plans Outflank New,"Attempt to work around the enemy's flank, before launching an attack. Do not form up in the battle line. This is useful if you outnumber the enemy, or they are in a favorable position."
HPText Battle Plans Ambush New 1,"Stay hidden until an opportunity arises to attack the enemy in flank or rear. When ambushing units reveal themselves, they change to an attack or harass battle plan."
HPText Battle Plans Ambush New 2,"The ambush battle plan is only effective if the unit is in forest terrain.  In other terrain it will be treated as having a “Support” or “Harass” battle plan, depending on whether or not it has missiles."
HPText Battle Plans Ambush New 3,"If all units in a stack have the ambush battle plan, and the stack is in a forest hex, then that stack will be invisible to other players unless they have a stack immediately adjacent. If a stack starts hidden, a battle will not be triggered by moving adjacent to it."
HPText Battle Plans Defend New 1,"Form up in a battle line, and await the enemy attack. Hold position until melee combat begins, and then only attack enemy who are very close. Receive a small bonus to defense against both missile and melee attacks."
HPText Battle Plans Defend New 2,"The defend plan is useful when there is terrain to defend; to maximize missile fire against an enemy of largely melee units;  to keep particular units out of battle for as long as possible;  for infantry to best resist a force of horse archers; to await reinforcements, or to provide a rear guard to allow withdrawing units to escape."
HPText Battle Plans Defend New 3,"It can be dangerous to use against an enemy with numerous missile troops that could be engaged in melee, or in complex multi-force battles where units with the defend plan might ignore enemy in other parts of the battlefield."
HPHead Battle Plans Support,Support
HPText Battle Plans Support 1,"Form up into the battle line, but only engage enemy units that are very close, or that are attacking friendly units.  Chariots and cavalry with missiles, and foot units entirely armed with missiles can skirmish away from enemy provided that they have a nearby friendly unit to retreat behind."
HPText Battle Plans Support 2,"This is useful to allow missile units to be placed in the front line of a formation, while still being able to retreat to safety when the battle lines clash, and to keep the second line of a formation in place to protect against breakthroughs or attacks from flank or rear."
HPText Battle Plans Withdraw New,"Move towards the edge of the battlefield, and do not engage any enemy. If not in combat when half the battle time has elapsed, withdraw from the battle. Useful  for settler and moving artillery units, or to ensure the safety of a valuable unit.  For units to be able to withdraw successfully, there needs to be a rearguard left behind to delay the enemy."
HPText Battle Plans Intro 1 New,"During your turn you may assign a battle plans to each unit, that determines how it behaves in battle. By default it is set to attack, which is fine for most situations, but for important battles you may want to fine tune your tactics. If you set a defensive plan (ambush, defend, support or withdraw) for all units in a stack, it will stop when encountering enemy, rather than initiating a battle."
HPText Battle Plans Intro 3 New,"In siege battles, units with ""charge"" battle plans are used preferentially for assaults, followed by those with ""attack"" plans. Units with ""defend"" plans are least likely to be used, and those with ""withdraw"" plans won't be used at all."
HPHead Battle Lines,Battle Lines
HPText Battle Lines 1,"In open field battles units will generally form up into opposing battle lines before engaging. Stacks that start the battle close together will form into the same battle line, but widely separated forces will form their own lines. Armies never form battle lines in siege battles, and may not in very small battles."
HPText Battle Lines 2,"A battle line may be either offensive or defensive. A line is offensive if at least one unit has an ""Attack"" battle plan, otherwise it is defensive. "
HPText Battle Lines 3,"A defensive line will wait for the enemy to attack, however it may adjust its position to defend a slope or river bank."
HPText Battle Lines 4,"An offensive battle line will form up and advance on the enemy to engage them in combat. However if it may first halt within missile range if it has more missile troops than the enemy;  if half or more of the units in the front line have missiles, or if units in the army have “outflank” or “harass” battle plans."

DR Must make peace with overlord,We cannot make peace with you until you make peace with our overlord.
Grand Campaign Desc,"The Grand Campaign presents a grand tour through the development of Chinese Civilization starting from the earliest recorded times, until the widespread adoption of gunpowder weapons (approx. 1500 BC to 1500 AD). Players start with a single town, and must guide their kingdom to hegemony. It is recommended that new players start with this scenario, as it contains a wealth of hints and useful advice."
Warring States 407 Desc,"This scenario is based on the historical situation around 407 BC early in the Warring States period of history. Each faction has already advanced to the Warring States era, and major factions control several settlements, with some infrastructure already constructed. The rate of technological development is reduced compared to the standard game. There is still considerable room for players to expand, but early conflict is likely for most factions."
Custom Game Desc,"A custom game creates a random world for you to play in. You can control the size and style of the map created, and the number of factions present. Each player begins with just one settlement. It is recommended particularly for multiplayer games, or for players wanting a smaller quicker game."
Zhao Short,Zhao
Zhao Full,Zhao
Zhao Desc,"Zhao is known as one of the three Jins, the states that broke away from the ancient state of Jin, and because of this will always be embroiled in the complicated politics of the North China Plain. Culturally, there is little to distinguish from it's Chinese neighbors, except that it serves as a conduit for culture from the steppe barbarians to the north. Eventually, Zhao reformed its army to incorporate the horse archery tactics of its barbarian neighbors, and became one of the strongest kingdoms of the Warring States Era.
"
Wei Short,Wei
Wei Full,Wei
Wei Desc,"Wei is the most central of the states that emerged from the break up of the ancient state of Jin. Its central position means that it has always had to fight hard for survival, but it has much fertile land to support itself, and was one of the first to reform and strengthen itself with legalist ideas. It is known for its well trained and equipped infantry soldiers.
"
Jin WS Short,Jin
Jin WS Full,Jin
Jin WS Desc,"Jin was a large ancient state controlling the Shanxi Plateau north of the Yellow River. However, it suffered from weak leadership, and after various civil wars, three of the major noble families declared their independence. They created the states of Han, Wei and Zhao, annexing most of Jin's territory. Currently the state of Jin controls no more than a small area around it's capital."
Song WS Short,Song
Song WS Full,Song
Song WS Desc,"When king Wu of Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, he was honor bound to ensure that the spirits of their previous kings would still receive sacrifices from their descendants This eventually led to the Shang king's estranged brother being enfiefed as the Duke of Song at Shangqiu. Although only a medium sized state, Song is a frequent participant in the wars of Northern China. Duke Xiang is infamous for considering it unsporting to attack an enemy army while it was crossing a river, which lead to his defeat and death. Some see him as a fool, others as the last remnant of a bygone era."
Zheng Short,Zheng
Zheng Full,Zheng
Zheng Desc,"The state of Zheng was founded by a cadet branch of the royal house of Zhou. It's position just to the south of the Yellow river, right in the center of the North China Plain, makes it a nexus for trade, giving it the wealth to be more powerful than its limited territory would suggest. Although the first state to adopt a formal code of laws, it is socially conservative, still practicing human sacrifice in burials."
Lu Short,Lu
Lu Full,Lu
Lu Desc,"The state of Lu was founded by the King of Zhou's brother the Duke of Zhou soon after their overthrow of Shang, in order to project their power eastwards. Initially it was a strong state, but controlling only a small territory, it became overshadowed by more powerful neighbors. It is mainly famous as the birthplace of Confucius, who often used the Duke of Zhou as an exemplar of a virtuous ruler. The famous Annals of Spring and Autumn are an account of events as seen from Lu spanning more than 200 years."
Qi Short,Qi
Qi Full,Qi
Qi Desc,"Qi is a prosperous well organized state in the East of China. It is rich from taxes on trade, and monopolies on various goods and services, including state licensed brothels. It's rulers are cultured and sponsor the Jixia Academy that attracts many noted scholars. However, they are often regarded as arrogant and uncaring of the common people. Qi's armies are numerous, and favor shock combat, but there are few incentives for the common soldier, leading to a general lack of enthusiasm and effectiveness.
"
Yue Short,Yue
Yue Full,Yue
Yue Desc,"The kingdom of Yue hails from the south of China, and has recently annexed the kingdom of Wu. Its culture is mainly Chinese, but mixed with that of the native southern peoples. Yue people excel in building and sailing boats and ships, and its craftsmen are renowned for metalwork and sword making. It has recently moved its capital to Langye, a long way from its heartland, in the hope of expanding into the northern plain.
"
Yan Short,Yan
Yan Full,Yan
Yan Desc,"Situated in the north east of China, Yan is the most northerly kingdom of the Warring States era. Its people are honest and down to earth and it's craftsmen excel in bronze and iron work. Yan's capital is at Ji near present day Beijing, but it also controls the large city of Xiadu which was one of the largest cities in the world during the 5th century BC. Being beset by barbarian tribes from Manchuria and the Mongolian Steppes, it's military has developed a doctrine that emphasizes defensive tactics and fortifications.
"
Zhongshan Short,Zhongshan
Zhongshan Full,Zhongshan
Zhongshan Desc,"Zhongshan, whose name means ""central mountain"" is a small kingdom in the north of China. It was founded by the barbarian Di people, but they have now fully adopted Chinese culture. However, a little of their ancient warrior spirit survives, and helps their small state survive amongst larger rivals."
Dong Hu Short,Dong Hu
Dong Hu Full,Dong Hu
Dong Hu Desc,"The Dong Hu, whose name comes from the Chinese term meaning eastern barbarians, are a confederation of tribes living in Manchuria and eastern Mongolia. They practice both nomadic animal husbandry and agriculture. They excel in cavalry tactics, and are also skilled craftsmen. Later descendants of theirs became the Xianbei, Khitans, and Mongols."
Qin WS Desc,"The Qin started as a small fiefdom at the periphery of Chinese civilization, but following barbarian incursions that drove the Zhou from the West, they have expanded to control most of the Wei river valley. This region, the land between the passes, is quite secure being accessible by only a few easily defended paths, and offers them an excellent base to build the strength needed to conquer the whole of China. The Qin are well organized and ruthlessly warlike, if a little uncultured. Historically they could be considered the winners of this scenario, as their leader King Zheng conquered all the other Chinese states and assumed the title of ""Shi Huangdi"" or ""First Emperor."
Zhou WS Desc,"The Zhou are the nominal feudal overlords of all the Chinese states, dating back to the time when they overthrew the Shang dynasty. However, several hundred years ago, they were driven from their homeland in the West by Rong barbarians, and now control only a small area around their eastern capital. Many see their former rule as a golden era, and they still enjoy a certain lingering prestige, but any suzerainty over the other states is now purely nominal, and most are far more powerful than Zhou."
Han WS Desc,"The Han are one of the three Jins, the states that broke away from that formerly large state. Their power base is south of the Yellow River, but they also have lands to the north, making their position complicated, and difficult to defend. Their people are renowned for their skill at crossbow manufacture, and are efficient and orderly, but not particularly warlike."
Shu WS Desc,"The Shu are located in the Sichuan basin in the far west, with their capital Chengdu almost in the foothills of the Tibetan Plateau They are a well organized people, whose state and civilization arose separately from that of the rest of China. They have many expert craftsmen, and extensive trade networks, but apart from the occasional clash, are isolated from the politics and wars of the North and East."
Crossbow Militia,Peasant Crossbows
Crossbow Militia Desc,"A crossbow is easy to use, but packs a heavy punch, making it ideal for militia troops with only a little training. However, the complex trigger mechanism is complex to make, so only a nation with a wealth of skilled craftsmen can field such a unit."
Heavy Spear Militia,Peasant Heavy Spearmen
Heavy Spear Militia Desc,"Although armor is expensive, a wooden shield is cheap enough that most peasants can afford to equip themselves with one. It offers good protection against missiles, and combined with a long spear allows them to fend off must better trained of equipped opponents."
Horse Archer Militia,Peasant Horse Archers
Horse Archer Militia Desc,"In the lands of northern China close to Mongolia, horses are in more plentiful supply than else where, and many farmers can afford one. Following royal instructions, they have copied the dress and equipment of the neighboring barbarians, allowing them to form a militia better suited to combating the incursions of their opponents."
Picked Horse Archers,Picked Horse Archers
Picked Horse Archers Desc,"These men are the cream of the army, riding and shooting as skillfully as any barbarian born in a tent. They can move swiftly to counter any threats to the kingdom, or striking deep into enemy territory. They feared by civilized people and barbarians alike."
Noble Horse Archers,Noble Horse Archers
Noble Horse Archers Desc,"Following the royal order, these men have adopted barbarian dress and equipment, and learned the art of shooting a bow from horse back. However, they carry fine swords and wear strong armor, making them as dangerous in hand to hand combat, as when shooting arrows at a distance."
Picked Heavy Infantry,Wei Heavy Infantry
Picked Heavy Infantry Desc,"These men are hand picked to be the cream of the army, and are rewarded for their prowess with grants of land. They must be able to march 100 Li (41 Kilometers) per day, while wearing heavy armor. They carry both a halberd and a crossbow, and are equally skilled in the use of each."
Tiger Guards,Tiger Guards
Tiger Guards Desc,"These are the elite personal guards of the king, who guard him at court, when out hunting, or on the battlefield. Most are relatives of the royal house, and their time in the guards is a stepping stone to positions of higher command in the army or bureaucracy."
Five Family Chariots,Five Family Chariots
Five Family Chariots Desc,"There are the elite personal forces of the five leading families of the state of Qi. They are swift like sharp-pointed arrows, and in battle they are like thunder and lightning. When loosed, they are like the  wind and rain"
ED Ride Like a Barbarian,Ride Like a Barbarian
ED Ride Like a Barbarian Desc,"Our lands are constantly menaced by barbarians who ride swift as the wind on their sturdy horses. They easily evade us as we chase after them in our clumsy chariots, and when we do ride horses we are hampered by the unsuitable court clothing we wear. Therefore let us learn form these people, and have our soldiers adopt their dress and equipment, so that we can form an effective cavalry force to combat them."
ED Move Capital,Move Capital
ED Move Capital Desc,"Although our capital city has the familiarity of home, it's location is no longer suitable for the current situation. Therefore, from this day forth, we will hold court in this fine city and it shall serve as the new capital. Find quarters for the palace servants, and send word to the courtiers, state bureaucrats, and priests that they should move their residence here to better serve their lord."
EFF RecruitSpecialUnits,Allows recruitment of unit:
EFF MoveCapital,Moves the capital to the settlement where the faction leader currently is.
EFF NullifyDisasters,Removes the unrest effects of natural disasters
WS Advice Yan,"Your realm is a strip of land between the mountains to the North, and the Yellow Sea.to the South. Although your land is not extensive, your cities are large and prosperous.

Beyond the mountains are the Dong Hu barbarians, who you will have to deal with if you are to survive. If you can drive them away from your core cities and establish some outposts to protect against their raids, then you will have a secure position.

To the West and South are the large states of Zhao and Qi, and the smaller one of Zhongshan. While getting involved in the complicated alliances of Northern China may become an expensive entanglement, an ambitious ruler will monitor the situation and look for opportunities to expand his territories when his neighbors are weak.

The land to the East is mainly uninhabited, and offers an excellent opportunity to expand your kingdom. However there are many forests to clear, and marshes to drain, so turning the area into productive land will take some time."
WS Advice Qi,"Your state is located in the east of the North China plain, in the area of Shandong. Your lands are not large, but they are very productive, and your cities are rich from trade.

Many states are vying for control of the plains, and you will need to keep a close eye on the shifting alliances, and stop any one of them becoming too powerful. Bear in mind that too much war is bad for trade.

There is some room to expand to the North, but frequent flooding of the Yellow River will be troublesome. The small state of Lu to the South is ripe for capture, and it may also be possible take territory from the extensive but relatively weak state of Yue also to the South."
WS Advice Zhao,"Your realm is located along the Fen River just to the north of the Yellow River flood plain. Handan, your largest city is right in the center of the North China Plain, meaning that you will easily become embroiled in the complicated politics and wars of that region.

However, your kingdom has great potential for expansion to the north and to the west, provided that you can protect your settlers from the barbarians coming down from the Mongolian steppes.

As Zhao, you have the unique ability to reform your military (by issuing an edict) to adopt the horse archer tactics of the steppe peoples. This will aid you in your battles against them, and may also give you an edge over your Chinese rivals."
WS Advice Wei,"Your state has emerged from the break up of the ancient state of Jin, and as such its holdings are scattered and somewhat intermixed with the other break-away states. Your central position, mean that you are surrounded by many powerful neighbors, but there are also smaller states that you might annex.

Wars are inevitable, but if you can make peace with at least some of your rivals, then there are uninhabited lands that you can settle, and turn your state into a stronger more cohesive realm.

While your central position is challenging, with skillful diplomacy, you can set your neighbors against each other, and benefit from their misfortunes."
WS Advice Yue,"Your state was originally founded south of  the Yangtze river, but recently conquered the state of Wu, and expanded to control the area around the mouth of the Yangtze River. Filled with ambition you recently moved your capital far to the north as a springboard for further expansion. Defending this position may be difficult, and you may need to abandon it and concentrate on your core territory. 

Your lands are quite extensive, but they are sparsely populated, and your settlements scattered, leaving you vulnerable to attack by more powerful neighbors. Therefore, your immediate goals should be to secure peace with the surrounding states, while you consolidate and strengthen your realm.

You are well positioned to create a lucrative water borne trade empire, with trade routes running along the coast and along the major rivers."
WS Advice Qin,"You enjoy a secure position along  the Wei river valley, which is only accessible by a few easily defended routes. The barbarians to the west and north are the most likely to give you trouble.

You have some of room to expand within your own territories, and plenty of potential to expand to the South, and you should consider trying to conquer the state of Shu and annex its territory. To the East are many powerful states, who will often be fighting each other. Look for opportunities to expand here when they are preoccupied with each other."
WS Advice Han,"Your territory is rather scattered, with settlements both north and south of the Yellow River. Holding on to everything may be a challenge, so you should avoid a two front war and do whatever it takes to secure peace with either the Northern or Southern neighbors.

There is some room for expansion both north and south of the river, with the south perhaps being a little better. There are also the small states of Zhou and Zheng that you could conquer. However, beware of Chu to your south, as they have relatively few targets other than Han."
WS Advice Chu,"You start in control of a large swathe of territory on the north bank of the Yangtze River. On paper you are wealthy and powerful, but your cities are far apart. Individually, none of your neighbors is a match for you, but given the distances involved, fighting two at once could be difficult. You have much empty territory to exploit, so it might be wise to concentrate on internal development for a while, and let others waste their strength fighting.

Your capital is on the banks of the Yangtze river. Consider exploiting this waterway as highway for movement, and a route for trade. It's also a route you can use to attack Shu and Ba to the West, and Yue to the East."
WS Advice Shu,"You start far to the West in the Sichuan basin, away from most of the other great powers. Compared to those you are relatively weak, but have plenty of space to develop and grow. Your biggest danger is Qin to the north, so try to secure peace with them until you are strong enough to fight.

The state of Ba is your natural rival for domination of Sichuan, and some conflict with them is probably inevitable. "
WS Advice Ba,"You start in the south of China with a state that straddles the middle reaches of the Yangtze river. Your main avenues for expansion are to the South and to the West. The land to the South is uninhabited and undeveloped, but there are many forests to clear and marshes to drain before you can build great cities. Sichuan, the land to the west is more promising, but will bring you into conflict with Shu and Qin.

Initially you are one of the weaker powers, and so should avoid conflict. However, you need to prepared to assert yourself against Shu to claim your share of Sichuan."
WS Advice ZhongShan,"You are a small state in northern China, surrounded by more powerful ones. Survival should be your main priority to begin with. Given your small starting territory, any war could be devastating, but may be difficult to avoid since you are tempting target for larger states looking to expand. Try to secure some powerful allies, or consider becoming a vassal to one of your neighbors.

If you can survive, there is space to expand into to the East around the mouth of the Yellow river, and to the North. Expanding east is easier, but is a high risk strategy, and will expose you to both hostile attacks and frequent flooding. Moving north will expose you to the Xiongnu and Dong Hu, but these have plenty of land available, so you may be able to buy them off."
WS Advice Jin,"Your once mighty state is now reduced to a single city near the Fen river. The neighboring states of Wei, Zhao and Han will be looking to swallow you up, so only some shrewd diplomacy will let you survive. There is space available to the west for expansion, but that will likely make you a target for Qin.

All in all, your position is extremely difficult, and survival  should be seen as an achievement in itself."
WS Advice Zheng,"You begin as a single city state to the south of the Yellow River. Although many of the surrounding states are more powerful, your city is well fortified and rich, so you are no pushover. There is some land around that you can use to expand, but you'll need careful diplomacy to defend your new settlements.

Although playing off your neighbors against each other may seem like the thing to do, much of your wealth comes from trade, and war is bad for business, even if you're not directly involved."
WS Advice Zhou,"Your state was once the overlord of all China, but is now reduced to a single city just south of the Yellow River. Restoring Zhou to its former glory will be a mammoth task, that will require great skill to achieve. However, your remaining city is rich and strong, so there is some hope.

The nearby powers of Han and Wei will see you as a tempting target, so your priority should be to secure good relations with them. This will allow you to expand into the surrounding empty lands and become stronger. However, scope for expansion is limited, so you will need to fight to expand further, and for that you will need allies. If you make the right alliances you will prosper, if not you will be extinguished."
WS Advice Song,"You start as a medium sized power, on the south side of the Yellow River. Your immediate neighbors are smaller states that may look like tempting targets to annex, but beware of them allying themselves with stronger powers. As ever with the smaller states, diplomacy will be the key to advancement.

You have some possibilities to expand your land, especially to the south. Also try to exploit your central position and access to the Yellow River to build a lucrative trade network."
WS Advice Lu,"Lu is a small state near the coast to the south of the Shandong Peninsula. All the surrounding powers are much stronger, and will be looking to gobble you up, particularly the powerful state of Qi to your north. You will need to ally with some of your neighbors to survive, and it may be necessary to become a vassal of one of them.

There is some limited space to expand, but holding a larger territory will be difficult. Expanding militarily will require joining in the wars of larger powers. Carefully picking the winning side will be key."
WS Advice Xianbei,"You play as a nomadic herding faction to the north. Currently there are no imminent threats, but you are quite weak and need to spread out and grow. There is limited space on the steppes to the far north, as the Dong Hu will block your progress, but there is plenty of room to expand in the big loop of the Yellow River to the south.

You are not in close contact with the any of the farming states, who lay mostly to the south and east, but the mobility of your light cavalry will let you form raiding parties with little fear of reprisals. This is a good way to raise money, which will otherwise be in short supply."
WS Advice Dong Hu,"You are unusual in that you have a mixed economy, combining both nomadic herdsmen  and settled farmers. This gives you options to exploit all the land around you. In the long run, farming on the fertile plains will be more lucrative, but farms are also harder to protect, so also make sure to have a few settlements of herders in the grassland to the north.

You start next to several farming states, and raiding them for loot can be a good extra source of income. However, try to spread the damage you do equally, lest any one of them become too strong. In particular beware the state of Yan to your south, it will likely defeat you in a full scale war."
WS Advice Dog Rong,"Your faction is a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes spread thinly across the western part of the map. Your confederation is weak and divided, but its remote location is its protection, and you have ample room to expand and grow stronger.

The lands in the west are not the best, but some small settlements here will be well protected from enemies, and you may be able to exploit reserves of gold or jade in the mountains. To the north east is a large area of grassland, that offers great opportunities for expansion. There are also opportunities in Sichuan to the south, particularly when the state of Shu is weak."
